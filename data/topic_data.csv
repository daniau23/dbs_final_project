Works great,2,I wish I would have gotten one earlier. I love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier,21,5.0,2022,10,October,29
I hope you have better luck with this mouse than I...,11,"I've learned this lesson (again). Open the package and use the product right away. I ordered this mouse in August as my 'travel' mouse and just packed it away in my bag. Now, I've been visiting family in the PNW since mid-September. The mouse took a charge and worked fine for a couple of weeks. After I recharged the mouse, it worked for a day or two and then ceased to function. The optical light will flash once when turned on then.... nothing. Of course, the return window is well past.",91,1.0,2022,10,October,29
Not worth it,3,It is so slow and lags find a better option,10,2.0,2022,10,October,29
Roller ball stopped working within 4 months of minimal use,10,Roller ball stopped working within 4 months of minimal use.  Piece of junk.,13,1.0,2022,10,October,29
The mouse will not hold a charge,7,I like the color and size but it’s a few days out of the return period and it will not hold a charge,23,1.0,2022,10,October,29
Middle Scroller randomly collapses and stops working,7,"Overall I love this mouse. The size, weight, clicking is all fabulous. However I’ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use, it wasn’t dropped, literally was not even touching it the second time and I heard it fall. If you need to use the middle scroller a lot I do not recommend purchase. If you don’t use that feature then it’s a great mouse.",73,3.0,2022,10,October,28
Stopped working,2,It stopped working,3,1.0,2022,10,October,28
Broke within a month.,4,"My son uses a school issued Chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse. So we looked into a wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews. Unfortunately, the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it a month. Since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case. He was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use. I am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at a campground. There is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but I have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable. I am sure this has been a great product for many and we likely got the dud so I am not telling anyone not to buy it but I am sharing our experience for others to consider.",180,1.0,2022,10,October,28
Wheel broken after 2 months,5,Loved this cute little mouse but it broke after 2 months. The wheel broke off from the gear.,18,1.0,2022,10,October,27
Stopped working,2,Should've spent the money to get a quality product. This thing stopped working after about a week. Worthless,18,1.0,2022,10,October,27
Lag time seems higher than expected,6,"Beautifully produced and lovely to look at for a mouse.  The lights are a welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace.  I did notice that it tends to go into a sleep mode quickly, but takes a longer ‘wake up’ time than I expect.  On a screen busy with windows, the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life.  It’s frustrating for anyone who isn’t patient.",70,3.0,2022,10,October,27
Cheaply made,2,First one broke in 1 week they sent a replacement and I returned broken one and it still hasn’t processed return now new one broke 2 weeks later.  I would not recommend this mouse,34,2.0,2022,10,October,27
Mouse stopped working within 2 months of purchase,8,I don't typically write reviews but I keep having this issue with tech products from amazon. The mouse stopped working after 2 months of use. It charges and sometimes I can get short term use out of it but it's very glitchy and lags across the screen.,47,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Broke within 3 months,4,I liked the wireless mouse however after 3 months the roller on the mouse stopped working which leaves me not being able to scroll up or down on my pc. I’ll have to look into buying a more sturdy mouse.,40,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Keeps breaking,2,The wheel from the mouse not working anymore. It only lasted for about 2 months. Really nice mouse but doesn't last.,21,3.0,2022,10,October,26

It doesn’t charge,3,Wouldn’t recommend have been trying to charge it for days!,10,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Disappointed,1,"I bought this in late June, it looks cool with the lights and all. It doesn't give a warning that the battery is low, just stops working. Now it is doing all kinds of weird stuff, clicking on items that you didn't, etc. Too late to return...oh well...not recommended.",49,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Didn't last long,3,After a few weeks the scroll wheel stopped working. I'm returning it.,12,2.0,2022,10,October,25
2nd one and already not working,6,This is the second time I have ordered this mouse. I actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and I have to order a new one. So for that reason I am only going to give you two stars. I ordered this particular mouse only two months ago and it’s already broken.  I should get my money back.,64,2.0,2022,10,October,25

Broke down after less than a year,7,"Bought this mouse on December 2021. Its October 2022 and no matter how long I charge it, the only thing it does is blink the red light once and die. Don't recommend this at all.",35,1.0,2022,10,October,25
Has to be charged regularly,5,"It works ok.  Nothing spectacular.  If you're a gamer or use the mouse quite a bit, you have to charge it about once a day, or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag.",41,3.0,2022,10,October,25
Bummed,1,Unfortunately this mouse stopped working after a month of use. Can I replace the item or get a refund?,19,1.0,2022,10,October,25
Worked great for a while,5,I had no issues with the mouse but I dropped it from not even 2ft from the ground (on accident of course) and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke. I’ve ordered another one and I hope it lasts longer than this one did.,45,4.0,2022,10,October,25

Cute little mouse,3,I bought this mouse to go with my work laptop when I have to travel to sites. I HATE using the pad that is built into the laptop. This is cute and little. I am thinking about using it for my personal laptop when gaming or doing school work.,49,5.0,2022,10,October,24
Easy in all ways,4,Got two of these with colors that matched out tablets. Easy to transport and just right feel in my hand. So far they work perfectly and at what I would consider a great price.,34,5.0,2022,10,October,24

Does not last,3,"I liked this product, until is stopped working 4 months later.",11,2.0,2022,10,October,24
Not too pleased,3,"I’ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way, the scroller. I do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller. I need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful. I won’t be buying a third one, BUT if that’s not gonna be a problem for you then these will probably be great. They hold a charge well and the light show they put on is really cool.",86,2.0,2022,10,October,24
Great,1,Easy to use,3,5.0,2022,10,October,24
Excellent,1," It's an excellent product. If you're looking for a wireless mouse, a good price and with high load durability, that's correct. I use it for work in ArcGis. Excellent service",30,5.0,2022,10,October,24
8 months in - scroll wheel broke; Short battery life,10,"As a lot of other reviewers said, the scroll wheel broke. I have had a different USB mouse for years without this problem. I'll be going back to it.The battery life is also very short. I'm constantly having to recharge it.",41,2.0,2022,10,October,24

High Defective Dead on Arrival Percentage,6,Repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for 1 second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight.  I searched for power issue reviews and found I am not the only one.  I cannot recommend this product and feel it should be taken down due to this.,54,1.0,2022,10,October,23
Poor Quality,2,Stopped working 1 month after I received this,8,1.0,2022,10,October,23

I'm using this mouse right now.,6,I purchased this mouse back in June of this year. It is now October. The battery life is soo powerful. The color changing is the best experience I could have ha with a mouse. I can't believe how happy I am with this purchase.,44,5.0,2022,10,October,20
Broke Really Fast,3,"The center scroll wheel broke in 3 weeks for no reason. Mouse was not dropped and barely used. Garbage, so you get what you pay for.",26,1.0,2022,10,October,20
Very disappointed,2,"Charged all night, and only last few minutes.This mouse has pretty design, but it's too thin to hold.Just asked for refund but not replaced.",24,2.0,2022,10,October,20
Piece of crap,3,This worked for a few months. I had to charge it overnight 2x a week as I work from home and used this mouse for my work laptop. After several months it stopped holding a charge and would have to be charged daily. Now it won’t charge or work. Super annoying because I really need a mouse and now I have to order another one. I had hoped this would last a LOT longer than 5 months but now I’m putting plastic into the landfill and it sucks.,88,1.0,2022,10,October,20
This mouse sucks!,3,"You could think it's a decent mouse for the price you paid. But, in reality, it is an uncomfortable mouse and barely works. The only good thing about this mouse is that it comes with a USB to USB-c adapter, which comes in handy.",44,1.0,2022,10,October,20
A good value,3,"A very reasonably priced cordless, rechargeable mouse with 3-button control with scroll wheel, which is my preference rather than the MacBookAir track pad or the Mac Mouse for the desktop Mac.",31,5.0,2022,10,October,20
It runs fast and smooth with little lag,8,"I would buy it against n. It’s pretty, not really bling, just sleek.",13,5.0,2022,10,October,20

Mouse,1,My first one I had about 2 weeks and the wheel broke loose and it would not work. I received a replacement in two days and it's perfect! Can't blame them for a manufacturing issue. I love my pink mouse. I highly recommend it. I use it 8 hours a day 5 days a week.,55,5.0,2022,10,October,18

No good!,2,"I purchased this mouse as the wheel on my old one quit working, I loved the design and wanted another so I ordered it and received it Aug 31, 2022 It is Oct 17, 2022, and the wheel just quick working again.  I would recommend looking at a different mouse if you prefer your scrolling feature.",56,1.0,2022,10,October,17
"Lasted 3 months, stopped charging",5,This item is poorly made. Battery died within 40 minutes after full charge (3 hours) It was returned the same day it was delivered.,24,1.0,2022,10,October,17
Purchased on August 11th It died on October 17th,9,"Mouse worked fine for 3 months, charged it every week or so. Then wouldn't charge via USB. Not good option for those who need something reliable.",26,1.0,2022,10,October,17
Didn't even last a month!,5,"Received product on the 12th, charged it and started using it. The charge didn't last that long maybe a day at most. But today (10/17/22) it doesn't work at all. Glad I kept my old battery one.",37,1.0,2022,10,October,17

Wake up! Hello mouse Wake up!,6,Performs as expected,3,3.0,2022,10,October,15
Feels a inexpensive,3,"Mouse seems to work ok. Looks nice, easy install, etc, Biggest complaint is the time out and wake up feature. Every time I go to use the PC, it's asleep. Then have to either click a button (which may/may not cause an action on the PC) or pick it up and down several times. Too annoying so stopped using it. Might keep it aside for use with my laptop when traveling, Definitely not for daily use.",76,4.0,2022,10,October,15

Scroll wheel broke at six weeks,6,I bought this mouse to match the keyboard I bought for my daughter to use with her laptop. She does online school and likes having a mouse as well as a keyboard. She likes that they match and both light up. I didn't know how it would be for gaming.,50,1.0,2022,10,October,13
Quick Quiet,2,Very easy to use and sleek design. It is small enough to fit easily into my computer bag when I have to take it with me.,26,5.0,2022,10,October,13

You get what you pay for,6,"This mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given. As is typical of many Amazon products, this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on.I would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future, and strongly suggest NOT BUYING THIS MOUSE. Unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don't work is a past time of yours. Then knock yourself out.",74,1.0,2022,10,October,12

this does not work,4,"These things stop working after a few weeks! I got two and one it just refuses to charge or stay on. The other, the scroller fell! Very poorly made! DO NOT PURCHASE!",32,1.0,2022,10,October,12
Stopped working,2,"I like how slim it is, and the colors are a nice touch without being distracting. Clicking is responsive, though the movement was a little glitchy (for me) sometimes. My biggest complaint is that the USB sticks out super far if you have to use the USB-C adapter.",48,2.0,2022,10,October,12
Stopped Working,2,"I was super exited for this to come, and it worked for about five minuted! The only thing that worked was the USB to type-C adapter!😠",26,1.0,2022,10,October,11

Works great on Mac Book Pro.,6,"I bought this mouse because it said it was rechargeable and I wouldn’t have to remember to always have batteries around. I used it for a few days and once the better inside died, I went to recharge it. I charged it for 5+ hours (even though it says the charge time is 2-3 hours) and then went to go use it and it does not work",67,5.0,2022,10,October,11

Scroll Wheel Broke after two months,6,Works on MacBook Pro.,4,1.0,2022,10,October,10
Garbage,1,"I loved this little mouse. It looked great. It felt great in my hand. The wheel was nice for scrolling. The battery even held a charge for what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. I would categorize my usage as light-moderate use (and no abuse).Then came the day, about a month after arrival, right after the return window closed, that it started glitching. Now, it drops off, not responding, then will work again, then drop off again and I’m not talking about sleep mode- this is during active use. Back and forth. Back and forth. It’s frustrating, probably more because I so desperately want a mouse instead of my laptop’s trackpad.All that said, I didn’t spend a whole lot of money on this mouse, so I get what I pay for. I just wish I had gotten a little more than a month before the glitching.",148,2.0,2022,10,October,10
Works great. Compact. Great value,5,The scroll button broke after just a month. Would not recommend,11,5.0,2022,10,October,10
"Nice, but not durable",4,"I was happy with this purchase until the mouse wheel quit working. I purchased this device on July 24, 2022 and a week ago (September 2022) it quit working. After looking through the questions, I see others have experienced this too. I wouldn't purchase this item. It's a known issue.",50,1.0,2022,10,October,10
Good but…,2,"I got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap. It really feels like its made of trash. It does seem to work well enough, though the tracking is inconsistent at best. The ergonomics are really non existent, doesn't seem like it's made for human hands.Overall, if you're buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it, but if you actually care about having a half decent mouse skip this one.",82,3.0,2022,10,October,10
You have to remember to turn on,7,Like it’s size. Perfect fit for laptop bag,8,4.0,2022,10,October,10

Good product,2,I love this mouse it’s quiet and pretty and the battery lasts a while I probably charge it once maybe twice a week,23,5.0,2022,10,October,09
Just ok,2,"It’s ergonomic and stylish. Very cute colors and cool lights. Comes with all the attachments like cords for charging and it has a small indent under the mouse to keep the part that plugs into your laptop. I’m forever losing mine so that’s a great feature. Very quiet as well. I recommend it for a nice, cheap little mouse.",59,2.0,2022,10,October,09

2nd Broken Mouse from this seller,6,"Just plugged it in and it worked perfectly.  I wanted a small, low profile mouse to use when I travel, so far this one seems great.  The Chromebook I travel with only has usb-C ports, and I did think that that this mouse came with a usb-c receiver, but it doesn't.  It comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is a little awkward.  It means I have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it.  If the receiver were smaller this would be ideal.  Overall, great value.",102,1.0,2022,10,October,02

It's size was ideal and it was overall comfortable and easy to use. However, this mouse does not hold a charge AT ALL. I had to charge it at least twice per week - remember this is not a mouse I used on my primary computer either!

Broke about 1 month after I got it,8,"when I first got this item it worked fine, but after a couple of weeks it was not moving the arrow very well.  I dropped it once and it stopped working altogether.",32,1.0,2022,09,September,13

Color struck!!!! Love it!!!,4,"I really liked using this mouse. It died a hair quicker than I’d like but I would just use it wired while it charged up. However, a month after using it, the middle scroll circle clicked down and wouldn’t come back up, making it impossible for me to use (as I use that often in playing Sims).  I didn’t expect much as I didn’t pay much, but I was slightly disappointed.",71,4.0,2022,09,September,13

Broke in less than 60 days of receiving,8,"I saw all the positive reviews and thought this would be a winner. At first, it was great - loved the colors, it is easy to use, but after a few months the scroll wheel stopped working. I dug a little deeper into the reviews and realized this is a common theme. Now I have to buy another mouse already - and it won't be another one of these!",69,1.0,2022,09,September,12

Cheap mouse with bad scroller,5,Lights are multicolored and are nice. Goes to sleep on its own and is great. Smooth and works fine. Until it breaks. Had it 4 months and 2 days and suddenly while scrolling the wheel broke,36,1.0,2022,09,September,07
stays charged; fast charge,4,This is the worst mouse ever it’s hard to glide and it goes dead very fast. Wish I could return it!,21,5.0,2022,09,September,07
Stopped working,2,Worthless to spend 20 min trouble shooting every time i need to use it.,14,2.0,2022,09,September,07
Poor battery life,3,"The center scroll wheel lasted less than a week. The mouse itself still works, but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with a wheel that doesn't work. Decent battery life. Bought a new, different brand mouse to replace it. The mouse also doesn't have much of an arch to it, so its not very ergonomic. Its better than a laptop track-pad though.",68,2.0,2022,09,September,07
Terrible,1,I love this mouse. I love how quite it is when I use it. Love the sleep feature on it as well. I have nothing bad to say about it. I use it for my online schooling.,37,1.0,2022,09,September,06

The 1 mouse did great no problem, the second was dead since our daughter likes colors. So we placed it on the charger last night and it's still charging. I unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge.....No charge at all.

Lasted barely a month,4,"I bought this for when I started working from home, after about 2 or 3 months the middle part no longer would scroll the page which is the reason I bought it in the first place. Very disappointing since that’s the reason I bought it in the first place.",49,1.0,2022,09,September,05
Just ok,2,"I have to charge this mouse way more than I expected especially since I use it for work.

Charge did not last very long. rt cord was conne on left side.,13,"My wrist no longer hurts after being on my computer. Sexy running lights let me see where it is on my desk.

Stopped Working Before Using,4,"Works great.  It’s a little too small and would stress my hand if I used it all day, everyday, but I don’t. So I’m keeping it and am content.  To be more specific, the buttons are not directly below my fingertips (which would be solved by a longer mouse OR an ergonomic one that has a little more height to it.). I’m an averaged sized male, and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha.  Hope this helps.",83,1.0,2022,09,September,04

Easy to use,3,"It was cheap and the lights are fun but it was cheap and doesn’t work great. Squeaky wheel as you’re scrolling, sometimes it doesn’t track well so that’s annoying. But it gets the job done if your patient. Select a different one.",42,5.0,2022,09,September,04

Junk,1,"When I first received this, I charged it as recommended and it lit up so seemed to work as expected. After charged, I put the toggle in my USB port and nothing happened. It didn’t download anything. It didn’t pair with my laptop. I let it sit then tried again. Nothing. It won’t charge. It won’t light up. Nothing. I never even used it and it stopped working. Very disappointed and a total waste of money.",76,1.0,2022,09,September,02
Breaks immediately,2,Ergonomic. I would also like to have a full size for desktop use. Multi-color LED adds a nice decorative touch. Mouse wakes up from sleep mode with first click.,29,1.0,2022,09,September,02

It was very easy to install,6,"My mouse, no matter how charged it is, loves to just randomly jump to the side of my screen. It's been like this since I first plugged it in... besides that, it's pretty, and I like how the lights combined. It's also really helped me with my carpal tunnel issues.",50,5.0,2022,08,August,31
Awesome mouse,2,"I ordered this product but the cursor kept jumping around the screen, even when it was fully charged. I figured I just got a bad apple so I made an exchange for a new one. The new mouse came scratched (not a big deal) and the scroll wheel wasn't as smooth (annoying but its fine) but this one's cursor is jumping around the screen too! I would have otherwise liked the mouse. It charges up quickly and I appreciate the sleep mode so that that battery life lasts longer.",89,5.0,2022,08,August,31
Love it,2,"Was good while it worked.  Used for basic office work, nothing heavy.  Scroll 'button' broke despite almost never using that function.",21,5.0,2022,08,August,31
Tiny and slim. I love it,6,"I bought this mouse on the 6th of August and it broke on the 31st of the same month.

Works great.,2,"I used this mouse for work as I am a hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces. When the mouse leaves my home office to go with me, it has its own individual protective/padded case in my work bag.  Worked great until it just stopped working, which is very disappointing after almost 4 months.The mouse still lights up, looks like it works, took a charge from the charger, but will not move on the screen in my work computer (Thinkpad) or personal computer (MacBook). That said, either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the USB dongle is defective per my IT consultant. I tried all possible USB ports, even those on my Apple Magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen. I also tried every idea I could find to reset/repair the issue in line to no avail.It is disappointing and a huge inconvenience this happened. You would expect a product to last more than 4 months. For my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool, they will now be told it died only after a short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one.I have yet to hear back from their customer service. And not sure I ever will. Maybe it is true after all, you get what you pay for. Now I need to buy another new mouse, which was something I hoped to not have to worry about for a long time.Please keep in mind, I do not leave this review to bash the company. This review is to let people know my experience with the mouse. Like I said, it worked great until it just stopped working (still lights up, just will not move on my screen) for no apparent reason as it work the night before (8/30/22).Buyer beware.",311,5.0,2022,08,August,30

Won’t turn on after 7x of use,7,"I like this item a lot. Very fairly priced and the low profile makes it easy on my hand. I don't have the largest hands, but not very small either and a mouse with a high hump is very uncomfortable. This solves that problem nicely. I could do without the sleep mode; I am still getting used to waking it up, and i understand the value of sleep mode so I deal with it. Never having to deal with batteries is also a bonus. Charging it overnight is ideal but I have already forgotten a couple of nights and it's fine. If necessary, you can plug it in and use it while it charges.",114,1.0,2022,08,August,28

Quiet Clicking!!,2,"I loved this mouse so much that I bought one for my daughter and my mom. I’ve only had this for less than 2 months and it just stopped working.

Stopped working,2,"I bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break.  To be honest, I loved this mouse  at first - the lights, the feel, everything.  However, I was not a fan of the extra added adapter to make it USB-C compatible.  Here I am 2 months after I bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well.  For some reason the companies that make these portable mouse (mice?) cannot make one that has a sturdy mouse wheel.  Oddly enough, the one thing I didn't like about the mouse originally, became my favorite thing now that it is broken - the adapter to allow me to run regular USB on a USB-C port.",118,1.0,2022,08,August,26
Great,1,Within a week of my son using it the scroll button broke. Somehow it’s outside the return window so now we are stuck with it.,25,4.0,2022,08,August,26
Quiet Click & Scroll,4,"I ordered 2 - the track ball broken in the silver one within 60 days, the right click broke on the rose gold one within 90 days. I only use them for light use - no gaming and they are not sturdy at all. They were both difficult to charge",50,5.0,2022,08,August,25

Poor quality,2,I’ve used it only for 6-7 times from Jan to July. Now it won’t on. Don’t buy,17,1.0,2022,08,August,25
The scroll wheel stopped functioning,5,This product is very cheaply made. I purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse.

I RECOMMEND THIS,3,I use this mouse for work. It didn’t require any weird setup like downloading software. It’s super comfy and has a sleep mode that activates after about 15 minutes. A click of the button wakes it up and it’s ready to go. I don’t regularly use the light up mode but it is a cool feature that is fun to show off. I have carpal tunnel and it’s so much better on my wrist than a standard wired computer mouse. Most definitely worth the purchase!,85,5.0,2022,08,August,25
Don't do it.,3,The scroll wheels does not work on this mouse,9,1.0,2022,08,August,25
Mouse will not work,4,The mouse itself is great - works well. however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works. It has only been 6 weeks since purchase.I do like that the lights have an on/off function so you don't need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in a work environment.,61,2.0,2022,08,August,25
Gum all machine,3,I use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons. Which is nice when we are quietly working on things. I would highly recommend! The color changing is also great!,40,1.0,2022,08,August,25
JUNK,1,I guess almost a year for under $10 is good enough.  Especially if you want one that recharges because you don't like fooling around with AA batteries. Battery life was good. I could use it all day with no problems.,40,1.0,2022,08,August,25
Broke within a month.,4,"About 7 weeks, after return window closed, quit working completely. I should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day. Spent a lot of time fooling around with a mouse, a tool that should be something you don’t have to think about or make plans to be available for use. Going back to tried and true battery wireless which lasts about a year and no hassle.",71,1.0,2022,08,August,25
Easy to use,3,Good,1,5.0,2022,08,August,24
LED Wireless Mouse,3,It was most important to me to have a quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop. This mouse has quiet/silent scrolling and silent clicking. Very impressed! The mouse is more of a flat design. The lights around it are pretty neat. There is an on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well. Nice mouse for a great price.,66,5.0,2022,08,August,24
It stopped working less than an hour after purchase,9,It was fine until it just stopped working 3 months in. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a well known brand like Logitech.,29,1.0,2022,08,August,24
Does not work good,4,"I bought five of them this year and three already broke after a few months of light use. Two had the plastic wheel axle broken, the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by Windows anymore. In addition, the USB dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop USB port. This mouse is flimsy and does not last. Not very ergonomical as well. Cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse, but it eats battery. Avoid.",82,1.0,2022,08,August,24
Really cool looking and easy to use,7,"I Purchased this for my office work and it broke down after 2weeks, the scroll wheel stopped functioning. Be aware of this and look for something else with better quality.Thanks",30,5.0,2022,08,August,24
Horrible!,1,Do not recommend! Just purchased in June and it's already broken in August.,13,1.0,2022,08,August,23
favorite mouse ever,3,"I have logitech keyboard that I use with no problem with my other mouse, but when i plug this mouse in, the keyboard stops working. The dongle is also hard to remove from the back of the mouse. I had to get something small to pry it out. I little space for your finger to grab it more easily would have been nice.",63,5.0,2022,08,August,23

Worked great,2,Mouse will not work. I have only had it for about 45 days and the mouse just stopped working. Will not charge either.,23,5.0,2022,08,August,23

No more batteries! Kool features~,5,Ease of installing and very super cool looking at my laptop!,11,5.0,2022,08,August,21

Works well the scroll broke after a couple month,9,"This mouse has The Quietest click of any mouse I've ever owned. And it puts itself to sleep if I don't move it for a while. It's magical. I wasn't sure about the color changing light, but it's not overpowering or distracting. I've had a very long line of previous wireless mice, but I think this is my favorite. Very pleased with this purchase.",64,2.0,2022,08,August,21
It died after 5months,4,Broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the Amazon return policy on electronics I have a tendency to buy it and I leave it sitting in the box for way too long.  Bad me because this is the second or third time I’ve gotten burned on crap like this.,53,1.0,2022,08,August,21

"well fitted, reasonable price, sound good!",6," The ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing. It is lightweight and feels cheap. White matches my setup but it’s translucent and takes way from the aesthetic. It is connected less than a ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag. It makes it completely useless to me. I don’t recommend you buy it, at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging.",76,5.0,2022,08,August,20
Great for 4 months - then it broke,8,"Great product, very competitive price.",5,2.0,2022,08,August,20
After 2 months mouse is KAPUT!,6,I purchased for my kids to use while doing online class work. It was easy to set up and seems to work well. I was hoping for something that felt more sturdy. It feels very cheap. The kids love the changing lights while they use the mouse. My only complaint is that if they don’t remember to turn off the noise after use then it dies and has to be recharged before if can be used again,77,1.0,2022,08,August,20
Died within one month,4,"Loved this mouse but it breaks super easily. I liked it and figured I'd give it another chance so I bought a second one and it broke after 3 months. It's soft to the touch, and very quiet which I liked. Unfortunately, both times the scroll button stopped working (feels like it detaches). You get what you pay for.",59,1.0,2022,08,August,19
Love it!,2,I really like this. This is a replacement for a broken battery operated one I used to have. I love that this can charge from a USB port and I'm not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time. It's got cool lights around the side and it works well on a lot of surfaces. I use my laptop in a recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine. I've also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results. It does take just a second when the laptop boots up to locate but that's minimal. The USB wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all. All in all I've been very happy with the quality and efficiency. This was a great purchase.,155,5.0,2022,08,August,19
Short Lifespan,2,I have never used it because everything is in Chinese even the machine it self .,16,3.0,2022,08,August,19
Ugh,1,I like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging. The only thing is I wish it would show you how much battery it has left.,40,1.0,2022,08,August,19
Love that I can usb charge it.,7,Good for the price. It also doesn't make the typical mouse clicking sound. You can barely hear it.,18,4.0,2022,08,August,19

Thin and comfortable,3,I received this product in the mail and when first handled it felt very cheap.. I proceeded to use it on my laptop and the mouse wheel wasn’t working at all,31,4.0,2022,08,August,11
Almost perfect,2,"I was not fond of this mouse - the ergonomics too flat or charge life. Now after 5 months of average to minimum use it will not charge. My system gives an error message of ""malfunctioning device"". I tried a different USB cord with the same response.I DONOT RECOMMEND THIS MOUSE!",51,4.0,2022,08,August,18
Broke just 3 days after the return window (with only 12 days of actual use),15,"Exactly what I was looking for, but get a longer micro-USB to USB-A charging cable. The one it comes with is only about 3 inches long—just long enough to charge off your laptop.",33,1.0,2022,08,August,18

junk lasted 2 months with minimal use,7,"Loved this mouse. Worked great. After having it for 4 months, the scrolling piece in the middle broke. I was not rough with it. I did not drop it. Just stopped working out of nowhere.",35,1.0,2022,08,August,18
Works great,2,I loved this product when I first received it. It lit up and lightweight and just pretty. But that was very short lived. It stopped working after just 2 weeks of using it. Good thing it was on the cheaper side. Maybe it was a disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for a short period?,57,4.0,2022,08,August,18

Good Mouse,2,"I bought this a first time and after a few months it died completely, even after being charged it will not respond when turned back on.

Liked it so much got a 2nd,7,"It’s lightweight, colorful, and it charges using a usb. No more changing out batteries. I love that!! It does go into sleep mode when I haven’t used it for a period of time (meaning it’s just idling). I haven’t found out how to wake it up so I just flip it over switch it off and on back again to resume using it.",63,5.0,2022,08,August,17
NOT WOTH IT,3,Worked great while it lasted. The roller wheel stopped working first week back to school after summer break.  The roller wheel just spins in place. One of the “arms” snapped. It has been kept in a protective pouch.,38,1.0,2022,08,August,17
No good,2,"Love the LED lights, connects quickly. The rechargeable feature is great until you forget to recharge",16,1.0,2022,08,August,17
i like it,3,"I have small hands and my old mouse was too big for my hand.  This mouse is lower, so I don't need to move my wrist and fingers higher to click.  It's not a cure, but it's great that it fits my hand much better and doesn't put as much strain on my hand.",54,5.0,2022,08,August,17

Brakes easy,2,"after 2 months of somewhat daily usage just for checking emails occasionally or something fast, the middle wheel stopped working making it a pain in my ass to use. I would recommend staying clear since it only has a 30-day warranty.",41,1.0,2022,08,August,16

Broke after 1 month,4,"When my 5 year old wired mouse finally died I started looking at replacement options.  I have never liked wireless mice due to the constant need for batteries and finding some in the office or while traveling is always a huge pain.  Finding out that there are rechargeable options out there was a game changer.  So far after about two weeks of use I love feel of the mouse, the pointer speed which is adjustable, and well the fact that I just plug it in to charge.  While the receiver is USB A and comes with an adapter for USB C, the charging port on the mouse is micro USB, the charging cable that comes with is USB A to micro USB (~6 inches) incase you want a longer one like I did.  One thing though, I do have small hands so the size is perfect, someone with small to medium sized hands will like the feel and size of the mouse, if you have large hands it may feel to small.All in all I liked it so much I ordered a 2nd one for my work laptop bag to replace the wired mouse that I travel with.",198,1.0,2022,08,August,15
Didn’t last long,3,"Not worth it, I had this for only 3 months and it broke. It just stopped working, I could not scroll at all no matter what I did. NOT WORTH THE MONEY.

Not worth even the little it costs,7,"I really like this mouse, it is low profile and fits my small hands perfectly.

Makes work fun!,3,"This mouse is wonderful to use for precise things such as line drawing and making flow charts.  It is super comfortable to use.  Unfortunately,  I bought this at the beginning of the year and now it will not charge, so I basically now have a corded mouse which is what I needed to avoid.  So, until I find a highly rated cordless, or a battery operated one, I will be tied to the computer (literally)",75,5.0,2022,08,August,15

the worst quality ever,4,"The mouse worked well for 1 day, but nowhere cursor is non-responsive. I checked to make sure it was fully charged, did some troubleshooting, and moved the USB to multiple ports on the laptop. Nothing worked. I'm guessing I just received a dud? Or maybe the mouse just isn't compatible with my laptop? I've used multiple wireless mouses with this laptop; this is the first time I've ever had an issue. Make sure you try the mouse out right away (after charging) upon receiving it (incase it doesn't work and needs to be returned).",94,1.0,2022,08,August,14

Faulty,1,It was working well until it just stopped working after 3 months. It won’t charge and turn on anymore pretty much useless now. Not well made and it’s a waste of money if you’re looking for a reliable and and an item that will last long do not get this one coz you will be disappointed. I tried my luck and didn’t listen to the reviews I read now I am so disappointed. Could have spend $10 more to a most reliable and long lasting one.,86,1.0,2022,08,August,13

Bag is awesome love it....,5,"Pretty easy to use and set up, comes with a charger. I expected the lights to be a bit more appealing but they’re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode. Fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain. Probably wouldn’t use for gaming purposes though.",58,5.0,2022,08,August,08
works well. good quality for money spent,7,Purchased for daughter and she didn’t like the ergonomics of it. I threw it in my work travel bag and have ended up using it. Works well and battery lasts a while. It’s also a nice conversation piece in meetings ;-),41,4.0,2022,08,August,08

"Works smoothly, the colors are fun",6,"After exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke. I tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is a pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse. The lights are kind of distracting & not necessary. However, it does stay charged for a week or more at a time. I'm cheap and bought this for data work. It works (other than the middle wheel now) and is okay for the price or if you don't have high expectations.",86,5.0,2022,08,August,02

Great for the price,4,"This mouse is super cute! It is lightweight, and the color matched perfectly to the picture (I got dark gray to match my Macbook Pro). The click is silent, which I love. The LED lights are bright and colorful. There is also a setting where you can just have red lights, but I love the color changing. The only downside is that this mouse does not hold a charge long enough to last my entire workday. I've started switching it off when I am away from my desk, and that help some. Charging is simple, though.",96,4.0,2022,08,August,01
Long life!,2,"I loved the look and feel of this mouse. However, it stopped working after only a week of using. It won’t charge at all and a coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse. Don’t waste your money!",41,5.0,2022,08,August,01
good mouse,2,"I was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when I received it. I couldn't have asked for more for the money. It's comfortable in my hand.

This morning I go to use the mouse and it still is not working, despite it being fully charged. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I am extremely disappointed because I just bought this mouse on June 29th, meaning that the return window closed on July 29th.

Led mouse,2,"This came with an adaptor to fit the Apple laptop, but is not made specifically for Apple products. The charge does not last long and needs a special adaptor. I prefer a battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome.  The three settings for on off are also less than ideal.

I love it!!,3,"Update - I lost my favorite mouse today. I bought it on Jun 12, 2022, reviewed it Aug 1, 2022, and it died yesterday, Aug 2, 2022. So the mouse lasted appx 11 weeks. Two and a half months is a pretty disappointing lifespan. The battery died so I plugged it in, as always, yet it doesn't connect anymore. I've tried removing the USB transmitter, rebooting the computer, plunging it in and out, and turning it off and on, but nothing. I even tried 're-charging' it, but nope. It's a lost cause.I bought this mouse to replace the wireless Logitech I was using for my laptop. It died and I decided to try this rechargeable mouse from OKIMO. I never heard of the brand but I'm impressed.This first charge lasted so long that I almost forgot it was rechargeable. I bought it in mid-June (It's Aug 1, 2022 today) and I'm just on my second charge. The first charge lasted over a month.This mouse does shut off after it's idle for a while and I'm sure that is the secret to the long battery life. Just a quick left click and it's back in business almost immediately.I love the slim feel of this mouse. It works beautifully.I thought the changing light would bother me (I'm old - 57) but it doesn't. It's more like a pleasant subdued highlight effect.I'll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so I don't get them mixed up.",247,5.0,2022,07,July,30

A waste of money,4,It is exactly as pictured. works well.,7,1.0,2022,07,July,29
"Very sleek, comfortable design",4, Aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow. I like how it's wireless and it can even work from a small distance away on another table from separate from my computer. It works very well. It has an on and off button for storage.,51,5.0,2022,07,July,29
SCROLLING WHEEL STOPPED WORKING,4,Just love the narrow band of changing colors around the mouse. It's so cheerful.,14,2.0,2022,07,July,29

Broke within three months,4,It works,2,1.0,2022,07,July,28
Stopped working after a couple months,6,"This thing works well most of the time. If you don’t turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode, it dies fairly quickly but you still get a couple of days of use out of it (if you’re not using it 8 hours a day, at least). If you turn it off every time you’re done though you can get probably a month but at least 2 weeks out of it with moderate use. I originally bought it to use with my iPad, however the case on my iPad wouldn’t really allow the USB-C to plug into the charger port. I wish they made an option to get either a USB or a USB-C plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the USB into the USB-C adapter which makes the USB-C plug significantly thicker than necessary. Now I use it for my MacBook. Just a warning, if you want it to scroll like a regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer (but that’s a MacBook problem not a problem with this mouse, not all of Apple’s setting decisions make sense but that’s nothing new). I do really like that I can chose to just turn on the mouse with a solid red color (which preserves battery) or turn it on to change colors (reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is a cool feature). My only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn’t tracking perfectly and the cursor is in a completely different place than I would expect it to be (further behind where I was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing), but that may also be a thing I have to change on the laptop.",300,1.0,2022,07,July,28

Great Upgrade,2,"I've been using Logitech Marble Mice for years, maybe over a decade.  I just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips.  But it's weakness is that the Marble Mouse's scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks a legit scroll wheel.  That is probably the sole reason I bought this LED wireless mouse.The LED mouse seems to function well.  It has a sleep mode that easily wakes up and had a pretty color light around it.  I don't use it for general mousing, but for scrolling.  Once i get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk, in my lap. wherever.  It makes up for what I don't have with my Marble Mouse.  The price was right and I think if it's what I paid for it it's a good, cheap addition.",141,5.0,2022,07,July,28

Doesn’t last long,3,This mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use. I love the lights that constantly change while you're using it. The best part for me is the fact that it's rechargeable...just plug it into any USB (I plug it into my laptop at the end of the day) battery usually lasts me a few full days of work.

Nice mouse,2,"I bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading. I then realized the on/off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions. One click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red. Two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear. I will say the white mouse is almost translucent, the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse, not just the sides. It's plug and play, very easy to use and comfortable.",82,5.0,2022,07,July,27
Stopped Working,2,"This is probably my second review in life because I hate leaving them. But I'm very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after a month of use. I don't even use it every day. Hell, I don't even use it every other day, so this definite came as a shock. Of course, the return window is closed, which go figure when you sell a cheap mouse and the seller isn't easily accessible. I'd like to think out of good character and business that I would be able to replace this mouse as I love the color and the lights on it, but what's the point if it no longer serves its purpose ???",115,1.0,2022,07,July,27

Scroll button broke first day using it,7,"Yeah, this thing is pretty great honestly. It works really well and is completely silent which I really like at work.

Doesn't work,2,"The mouse is cute, has quiet clicks, smooth glide, and is light.  It is also comfortable for your hand.  Like the rechargeable feature, as well",25,1.0,2022,07,July,21

MOUSE,1,Worked fine out of the box until it needed recharging and now won't charge.  It has a blue light on it so I know it's getting power but as soon as I disconnect the cord it's dead.  Worthless.,38,4.0,2022,07,July,21

Horrible,1,"Very nice sleek design. Was expecting a lot more given the reviews, but mouse stopped working after 2-3 weeks.

Completely stopped working after 107 days,6,"At first, this mouse was the best ever. However, whenever it touches a table, the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up. It was still very comfortable, though. However, 2-3 months later, whenever I turned it on, it would start autoclicking, and the only way to stop it is to remove the USB charger. It's great for the first months but then started failing me.",71,1.0,2022,07,July,19

Excellent!,1,Very satisfied with this mouse.,5,5.0,2022,07,July,18
"Small, slim design",3,"I bought this because it looked small and exactly what I was looking for. When I received it, I turned it on and it lit up.

Either way, I returned it and got my money back.",66,5.0,2022,07,July,18

"Literally just opened it straight from the package, DOESNT WORK! DONT BUY!",12,"Starting using on April 2, and when I came back to my desk yesterday it had completely stopped working. I can not charge it (i tried on multiple computers) and the computers won’t acknowledge it if it’s not plugged in directly (which defeats the purpose of the wireless chargeable mouse.Don’t buy if you are looking for a long term option.And I can’t find a way to contact the company.

light and comfortable,3,Was very happy with this purchase until the left click button started getting stuck and having to force it to work.

I hate it!,3,"I bought this last year not wanting to pay for a premium mouse, and after seeing so many comments. Turns out it's a mistake. The mouse stops working after a few months when i work from home. The pointer just doesn't react at all only the scroll works.

FABULOUS remote!!,2,"I bought this mouse so that I could use it with my MacBook. Unfortunately it barely works, I have tried for a year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it’s extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop. It’s extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic, I was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you’re better off not using it at all.",99,5.0,2022,07,July,13
Smooth!,1,Skip it,2,5.0,2022,07,July,13
Good basic mouse,3,I chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories. However the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable. It’s extremely light weight however I feel it is going to break easily since the plastic is so thin. So far for gaming I’ve had no issues with performance of the mouse itself.,57,5.0,2022,07,July,13
"loved it, but now...",4,Bought it in March and now the roller thing does NOT work. Mouse was never dropped.

needs no batteries,3,"I enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up, but that is essentially it. The battery storage on the mouse is super low, so you'll have to plug it in any way after about a half hour of use, maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow LED light feature. The mouse's scroll wheel broke on me in a middle of a game, not any aggressive game, mind you, just a house decorating sim and I've hardly used it for the six or so months I've had it.To sum up: For a quick, cheap purchase, it looks great but isn't worth it in the long run, and I regret not buying a different mouse.",116,5.0,2022,07,July,12

Great mouse,2,Decent mouse… looks and feels cheap and the light show kinda adds to the “cheapness” of the mouse. Cursor tracking is the biggest issue. The cursor doesnt track consistently smooth when moving it around on the screen and the DTS button doesn’t seem to do anything for controlling this.,49,5.0,2022,07,July,07
Excellent,1,Quiet and smooth,3,5.0,2022,07,July,07
Works great,2," Finally sleep mode works on this upgraded LED mouse, sleep mode is a must for a mouse because not every time you’ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for a short break or so it does it for you to save battery.Note: sleep mode does work on color mode, the previous mouse wouldn’t sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had Bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse!",82,5.0,2022,07,July,07

Scroll Wheel stopped working and product is defective.,8," I bought this mouse as a backup to keep in my laptop bag, and foolishly didn’t try to use it until the return window had already passed.It has never worked. I threw away my money.I’ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices, with the same results — nothing. I can’t find any info about the switch on the bottom, or how to troubleshoot, but when I plug the mouse in to charge it, it illuminates blue. When I actually try to use it, it blinks red and shuts off.It has never worked. Please don’t waste your money. Please learn from my mistake.",104,2.0,2022,07,July,06

Doesn’t work,2,"The good - has a separate USB dongle that stores away, and charges internally, ie, no need for a battery.The bad - The mouse tracking is very erratic - too fast, too slow, and could not find a setting that suited me. But what renders it unusable for me is the click latency - I have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work, or I end up dragging something I don't mean to. Some people may also find this mouse a bit too small.YMMV - Up to one's taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display - either just red, or it switches colors. I wish you could turn it off though, which unfortunately you can't.",124,1.0,2022,07,July,06
Silent clicks!!!,2,I like the size and the fact I don't have to change betteries,13,5.0,2022,07,July,06

Works for 1 month only,5,"Unfortunately I was in a hurry when I bought this and didn’t take the time to read the other reviews. Hopefully, you’re taking the time to read them. I got it and it never even turned on. I made sure I was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too, but it wouldn’t charge. The light would turn on when I plugged it in for a few minutes and then turn off. It looks like other people had this issue but a few weeks into using it, so at least it broke in time for me to return. Still a hassle",104,1.0,2022,06,June,30

Broken,1,"This mouse worked well for about 4 months. Then, it stopped holding a charge.  Even tethered to the laptop, it was not working well.

I do use it on a mouse pad which helps it move smoothly. It works on hard surfaces like my desk but not as smooth. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a mouse. Makes my online college classes easier. I've been using this for a out 2 months now and I e only charged it twice. Has a long battery life and sleep mode. To exit sleep mode just click the mouse once. Can't say I've seen any glitches that people are talking about. Maybe there's were defective. Mine works great. Thank you",127,1.0,2022,06,June,12

I do wish that you could turn on just the mouse and not the lights without there being a constant red light.However! After using the mouse for less than 2 months, the scroll wheel stopped working and I can't figure out why. I've tried cleaning it out, recharging the battery, and adjusting my driver settings with no luck. I'm definitely frustrated and because my return window has past I'm not sure how to reach out to customer service. :(",105,5.0,2022,06,June,05
It’s a good value,4,I was excited to get a mouse that was USB charge instead of batteries. Ive charged it once and it worked great for about a week which is awesome!

looks great,2,"I've been through two of these mice. The first one lasted only one day before the scroll wheel stopped working.

Performs really well,3,I was stunned by the quality of this great wireless mouse. With a charging port it never needs a battery since it is built-in. I've used the mouse for months and without recharging it goes and goes. A winner.,39,5.0,2022,06,June,03
Loved this mouse,3,IT WORKED FINE AND THEN STOP I BOUGHT TWO I HOPE THE OTHER ONE DOESN'T DIED TOO,17,5.0,2022,06,June,03
The usbc adapter does not work for the usbc port on a MacBook,13, Pros:-Quiet-Smooth-No delays or lagging issues so far-Pretty colors (when not moving the mouse)Cons:-Seems a bit cheap-A little flatter than I'd like; doesn't fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable-The red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you're moving the mouse.  I want to see the various colors (even when moving the mouse)---not a red LED light shining through which is overpowering.-Some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show.The right side of the mouse (I'm right-handed) doesn't emit the colors as vividly as the left side (next to my thumb).  One small section is almost inoperative.I'll probably be returning it as I have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn't emit the red LED like this one.  It was super cheap fortunately in case I keep it.  Who knows!  I guess you get what you pay for.,152,1.0,2022,06,June,03
"Good mouse, but usb-c does not work for mac",9,"I loved this mouse at first. However after just one one of using it, it just stopped working one day. Even after being charged the night before.

This is the second one that has stopped working for no reason,12,Mouse was working fine for about a week now the middle button to scroll stop working,16,1.0,2022,06,June,03
Love it!,2,I am big on reviews & peoples honest opinions when it counts. As for style it’s a nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good. Even if it’s completely charged it will only work for about 10/15 minutes before it starts to freeze & then eventually go dead. It’s very frustrating & annoying especially if you work from home. I would of posted a pic but I am in the process of returning it & don’t feel like getting it.,86,5.0,2022,06,June,02
Cute colors,2,"I love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn't run by batteries. This seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double a's but then you have to think about remembering to charge it. If you've been using it all day non stop, it starts to die by the night time. Other than that i think it's super cute. and it's pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces I didn't have much of an issue.",85,5.0,2022,06,June,02

Doesn’t hold charge,3,I just needed a wireless mouse for at work because I was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had.  The color is bright and the lights are a nice subtle change to working…they’re pretty.  The only thing I hate is that I have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up.  Nothing major but the sensor could be better.  It’s not overwhelmingly wonderful but it’s cute and is a good value considering the cost.,78,1.0,2022,06,June,01
Didn’t last long,3,So easy to hold. Just plug in the wireless receiver and turn on the power switch on the bottom of the mouse and start using. No batteries to install because the mouse is wireless.,34,1.0,2022,06,June,01
#1 Wireless Mouse,3,I bought this mouse for my Macbook and it would not even turn on! I charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop.

I should've just gone to best buy or target.,64,5.0,2022,05,May,27

Stopped working after the first recharge.,6,I bought one of these and in three months it completely stopped working. I couldn’t charge it or use it.

Gave issues after like three months,6,This mouse did not work from the get-go which is why I am certain I was not it's first owner. This mouse was missing the one part it needed to operate (a USB receiver) which is customarily located securely under the unit itself. The mouse was halfway in a sleeve as if RE-stuffed back into it's original packaging. Returning this immediately,61,2.0,2022,06,June,01

If I could this 0 stars I would,8,"Had high hope for this cute product. Was very disappointed. For starters, the charging light did not work so I couldn't tell if it was charging at all. When I tried it the next day after charging it did work (only directly plugged into my mac, wouldn't work in my adaptor which is another issue) and it worked that day. The next day it would not work. Already annoyed as I wasn't looking to charge this all day to work for only work hours. I did turn it off after each use as well. The next day it worked for even less time. Maybe only a couple of hours. This mouse is cheap junk and I don't recommend it to anyone.",121,1.0,2022,05,May,30

The LED light can be turned off, so that in itself could be remedied. But the optical light which is a bright red showed through the side lights, the gap between the switches and the DPI option switch. There was no way of blocking the light.

Unfortunately I cannot attach a video because it would be on company property and I don’t have a personal computer. I’ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other.

I returned it for a replacement and now, 3-4 weeks after receiving the replacement, that scroll wheel has also stopped working. Because the original purchase was outside the return window, a return was not possible. Would not buy again, and am going with a different product from a different seller/manufacturer.",83,1.0,2022,05,May,23

Type c doesn't work properly while connecting to MacBook Pro.,10,The Best! Ergonomic and lightweight. Feels comfortable after hours of use at my laptop. Fits perfectly in the pocket of a laptop bag. Not bulky like others I've tried. Stays charged for a long time. I love the color.,39,1.0,2022,05,May,23
Does not work with MacBook Pro,6,It's slim not bulky works well with my laptop love the lights great buy,14,1.0,2022,05,May,23
Broke after 3 months; used infrequently,6,you dont hear any clicking like normal mouses which is nice. The color is good and smooth as well. My only complaint is you have to move it back and forth sometimes to wake it up. Rather than that its a perfect mouse when its awake.,46,2.0,2022,05,May,22
NEVER HAVE TO CHARGE IT!,5,"Nice size, comfortable,  good battery life and plug in play.",10,5.0,2022,05,May,02
Great product,2,"It seems to work fine so far.  The lights around the side are constantly red until well charged, but then they rotate.  Very easy to set up, but does not seem to work when wired.",35,5.0,2022,05,May,22
A very good product,4,"Mouse worked great! was easy to connect and use. But stopped working and had to throw it away after 3-4 months of use. stopped charging, stopped working all together.",29,5.0,2022,05,May,22
Definitely would purchase again,4,looks so cheap. didn't even work properly.,7,5.0,2022,05,May,22
Died after a month,4,This mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on. This did not start happening until 6 weeks after the return window ended. I would not recommend buying this for these reasons. It was a waste of money.,44,1.0,2022,05,May,21

Like clicking a cloud,4,It’s super cute and I love how it lights up. Which is probably the reason why the charge doesn’t last very long. Just make sure you stay on top of it and it will work. I’m trying to avoid buying one with batteries but this one is in any better.,50,5.0,2022,05,May,20

Broke in 5 months,4,The mouse arrived today. Easy to set up. So far it is working properly. I like the fact that it's rechargeable. No more AA battery to replace. I'll have to get use to its size. A lot shorter than my old Morosoft mouse. Hope it lasts as long as the old mouse. Time will tell.,55,3.0,2022,05,May,20

Mouse,1,"I really liked the mouse at first, it matched perfectly and was very convenient. First thing i noticed was how plasticy it was, that didn't bother me tho. One day as i was using the mouse to scroll, the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse! i tried to fix it and i couldn't. I wasn't pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk. Its a cute mouse, love the look of it. But it is very cheaply made and will most likely break!",87,5.0,2022,05,May,20

Just as advertised,3,"Honestly it’s far less heavy than I would’ve liked. I don’t feel as though this will be adequate for long-term gaming but it’ll be alright for web surfing or writing. It’s also fairly small, then again I have pretty large hands. For the price, I couldn’t ask for much more, but I do think it’s important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is. Also, it DOES work with a macbook air despite the one star reviews. You have to connect the receiver to the adapter (it takes a good bit of force) and then plug it into the computer. I wish the instructions could’ve been more clear about that, but it’s whatever:",117,5.0,2022,05,May,19
Dont Let the Price or Lights Attract You!,8,This mouse is just trash. It’s lifespan is 32 days. Stopped working just 2 days after the return window closed. I don’t recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting. Getting tired of Amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse.,45,2.0,2022,05,May,19
Didn't last,2,Didn’t realize that there wasn’t a place to put a battery in so it always had to be charged. After two or three weeks I could no longer charge it and could not have it work. Cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long-term or if you spend a lot of time on the computer,57,2.0,2022,05,May,19

Broken adapter,2,Worked for 2 minutes the first time I turned on the mouse and then it just completely stopped working with my MacBook. Charged it for days and still does not work.,31,3.0,2022,05,May,19
Nice mouse,2,I liked this mouse just fine.  I bought it to use at school with my chromebook.  It was fine until a couple weeks ago. I scrolled the mouse wheel and something broke. Now the wheel just spins and spins and does nothing.  I only used it a few times a week for meetings and such. I would buy a better one; don't bother with this one.,66,5.0,2022,05,May,18
Stopped working after 3 days,5,This mouse is great quality and duration is excellent. This mouse goes uncharged for 2 months while being a university student.

Dies Quick + Poorly Constructed,5,"Charged up quickly in a little over an hour.  Looks great, feels great, but the scrolling wheel does not work.  Looking at it closely, it looks like the wheel is slightly off center.  It spins freely, like it isn't connected to anything.  Back it goes.",45,1.0,2022,05,May,18
Not awesome,2," Absolutely love it! And it is rechargeable, changes colors. The battery lasts forever.  5 stars",15,1.0,2022,05,May,17
horrible quality!,2,The mouse itself is nice but the USBc part does not fit into my surface nor does the USB part fit.  I bought this because i have a new surface and needed a USBc to USB connection so i could use the mouse with the surface.  I guess the specs are different in China.i had to go back and buy a USBc so i could use the mouse.  Attached is a picture of the one i had to buy.Do not recommend unless you want a project.,86,1.0,2022,05,May,17
I loved this mouse...BUT,4,"The tracking ball/wheel stopped working after a couple of months. Thinking I broke the tracking wheel, I ordered a new one and it arrived with the same issue straight out of the box. It works fine if you don't mind not having the tracking wheel.",45,2.0,2022,05,May,17

Stopped working,2,"Just so you know, I loved the simple Amazon wireless mouse, but our cats kept knocking it off the table and the battery cover would come off. Over and over (stupid cats!) But now, with this mouse, the battery is rechargeable, the cats can't tear it apart, and it has cool lights on it. The function is good, the price was low, everything is solid--so, I recommend it.",68,1.0,2022,05,May,17

Scroll broke,2,"Great mouse, nothing super fancy.  Comfortable to use.  The lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life. Holds a charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary. I plugged in to 2 different computers and worked immediately on both. Seems quite reaponsive, but I only use it for general computer work so i dont know how it would work for gaming. All in all great mouse for a decent price.Will update if anything changes",94,2.0,2022,05,May,16

I love the feel of the mouse and how sleek it is HOWEVER no matter how much I charge the mouse, it stops responding after about 5 minutes of use.

Perfect Desktop Mouse,3,"The mouse came as described with the option I chose. However, after letting it charge for the recommended time before use, it would not connect to my computer. Turned it off and then back on and it worked for about 30 minutes. Within that 30 minutes, only showed one color the whole time. It never worked again afterwards.

It connected to its included dongle just fine, but I almost broke a nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body. If you don't have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body, prepare for some ouchies. Do you like the rainbow effect? Well, I hope you also enjoy less than 1 day of battery life. Is your battery dead now? Welp, can't charge and use the mouse at the same time. Do you think it'd be nice to use a long, braided USB cord as a wire for this mouse? Nope, the Micro USB only supports charging...not data. Don't hate yourself? Don't get a budget mouse.If you want a good mouse for roughly $15 more, check out the Razer Basilisk X - it supports Bluetooth & USB, and it has excellent battery life.

I love that it is rechargable and has the lights. the lights change each time you touch the mouse on its side. thats cool. i also love how the top of the mouse is so smooth and the gold color is actually shiny. i didnt know before buying but it has a sleep mode so thats great for if i forget to turn it off. i have to double check the manual but there are 3 switches and i dont know what the middle switch is for since the mouse hasnt worked in that function. i think its cool too that they include the adapter if you need to plug it into a usb-c port to connect to your device.

Worthless,1," So far, so good! Does what it's supposed to do. Worked right out of the box. I like that I don't have to buy batteries for it.

It has two settings; solid red color (only when mouse is moving), and slow-changing rainbow (when mouse is moving and/or at rest).

Looks & works great,4,"I have been using this with my work laptop, which I use 8-9 hours daily for remote work. I’ve had this for a few weeks and only needed to charge once since then. I really love the feel of it, it’s a near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons. I like the look of it and the lights, so I know when it’s in sleep mode. Turns on and immediately works with one click. Completely operational when plugged in to charge as well. The charge cord is very short but I plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the USB port it was plugged into without being a nuisance. I would love for there to be a way to see the battery life on the mouse, it’s the only thing I would change/add.Very pleased and hope it lasts a long while!Update:This mouse is still going strong, still love it. I use it daily for work, 8+ a day, 5 days a week. Still love the lights lol.My one and ONLY complaint - I wish we could see the battery life of the mouse. I have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe (I hate the laptop mouse). It does work when plugged in and charging, tho, so that is nice, I just prefer wireless. Im not knocking off stars due to this at all, just offering a suggestion to somehow let us see the battery life remaining!",257,5.0,2022,04,April,27

Fun Mouse,2,This mouse is great!,4,4.0,2022,04,April,26
Fun and smooth,3,"I made the mistake of reading the reviews only after I bought the mouse, because it had 4.5 stars with something like 30,000 reviews so I thought it was fine. I saw a few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review! That made me really regret buying from such an unethical business. I don't think you should buy this mouse even if you're on a budget - there's much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs.This mouse is very cheaply made. As for performance issues:For one, it's way too thin and lightweight - When using it, it's very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it's not heavy enough (or grippy enough on the bottom) to stay where you put it. I've never had this issue with a mouse before. The tracking sensor is also way too sensitive - the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse a decent couple centimeters above the surface it's on. This also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it's still tracking movement when you lift it up.The cord to charge it is pretty short - although that's not a huge issue, just sort of disappointing. The biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes a bit of manhandling. It felt like I was going to break some of the cheap, thin plastic when I first plugged it in.As for looks:The edges where the ""paint"" or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough, and it even came with some of the paint chipped off. I bought the light pink mouse. It's not nearly as light as it is in the pictures. It's darker and much warmer toned rather than a cool light pink like the picture. It's also not as reflective as the pictures show but that's not a huge deal. You can turn off the RGB lights by the switch on the bottom if you want, but it still emits a red light when using it. I wish it didn't do that - it's ugly and probably wastes more power.",378,5.0,2022,04,April,26

great product until it wasn’t,5,I've bought 2 of these mouses. When the first one broke I thought it might just have been a dud. I really liked the mouse up until that point so I decided to get another one. It's been 6 weeks and the same issues. With both mouses the scroll button broke. While the mouse does still 'technically' work it's super inconvenient and annoying.,63,3.0,2022,04,April,26
Chintzy,1,The mouse is really pretty but the battery life is super short. It doesn't even last my 8hr workday after a full charge :(,24,2.0,2022,04,April,26
Exactly as expected!,3,"When I first got the item the color looked off. I ordered the Blue but I'm fairly positive based on the images I was sent Mint Green. I liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for a bit because it was so quiet. However, after only a week and a half, the mouse wheel stopped working. I could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so I opened it to investigate and it looked like there was a small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn't work anymore. I liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the RGB lights. It bothered me but that didn't affect the function. I wish this had worked better.",146,5.0,2022,04,April,26

Very poor quality.,3,Worked good for the first 2 months. Used the mouse on a security camera hard drive to review camera footage. Worked fine one time and after that no “cursor “ icon appeared. Tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available. It won’t select anything. Only right click works but can’t scroll to a selection. Luckily my desktop is touch screen so I manually opened up the drives properties and it’s said that All device functions are working properly.

Mouse doesn’t work without a mousepad,6,"Very nice mouse. It's super quiet! Exactly what I wanted. The lights are nice and change on their own. I haven't had to charge it yet, but it gets a ton of time off the initial charge.",37,1.0,2022,04,April,22
It's Garbage,2,The scroll wheel broke in the exact same way twice in the last 4 months. We opened the mouse up and it's not a simple fix so the first time we replaced it but this time we're just going with a different brand,43,1.0,2022,04,April,22
returned. stoped working after a month.,6,"When I bought this mouse I loved it. It took me a few tries to get it paired right, but it is a game changer for my laptop. The rechargeable battery life on it is great. I found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly, that it was time to charge it.I purchased it late September and at the end of April my roller has stopped working randomly. It worked and then I went to use it an hour later and it no longer does. The scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop. I'm disappointed.",99,1.0,2022,04,April,22
Nice mouse!,2,"product works as advertised. no issues. until the wheel simply stopped working one day, about 6 months in. you don’t realize how much you use said wheel until um you don’t have that function anymore. otherwise, great product.",38,5.0,2022,04,April,22

"Adpater doesn't work, mouse is fine",6,I’ve gone through 3 or 4 of these in less than a year. They are not durable in my teenagers hands. I’m sure they are not the most gentle with them  either. I buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year. I have switched brands recently to see if it’s them or this brand that just breaks. It’s always the scrollers that break.,71,2.0,2022,04,April,21
Issue,1,After the first use the mouse no longer holds a charge!,11,5.0,2022,04,April,21
Stopped working,2,"This mouse works as advertised. The changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for a new mouse on Amazon. I don't really like the slim feel to it, I feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time. I also was looking for specifically a USB-C mouse, and to make this one work with USB C you have to use the included adapter, which ends up sticking out quite a ways on the edge of your computer. This is clearly stated in the advertisement, I just didn't pay enough attention when I bought the mouse.",108,1.0,2022,04,April,21
What You See is What You Get,7,"The price of this mouse was cheap, and you will get just that with this product. It serves its purpose OK. I like the color changing LED lights. But this mouse is too lightweight for my liking, and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably. It feels like there is a lag when moving the arrow, just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work/office computer.",74,4.0,2022,04,April,21

Do not buy.  NO battery life!!!,6,"Literally from the box it won't light up or download the software to be able to use.

Doesn't last long,3,"I like that this mouse os sleek in design has a long battery life, and is easy to set up. I often forget to turn it off but that doesn't matter because it goes into a sleep mode to preserve battery. The only concern My tablet has a C type so the converter is helpful. The only thing that I would change is that the converter doesn't fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet.",90,2.0,2022,04,April,20

Perfect for office,3,"I get so many compliments about this mouse. I move location to location for my job and it’s held up just fine. Quiet click, smooth functionality, fun color changing LED… I love it! The only negative is that the charging cord is short and doesn’t also operate the mouse when plugged in, so make sure you have two USB plugs when needing a charge.",64,5.0,2022,04,April,18

No worth it won’t hold a charge,7,"I had the mouse working for one day, then I could not use it any further. The mouse pointer had a mind of it's own and would take over it's own movement.

"No longer connects, used sparingly for 2 months",8,"Liked this little mouse.  It holds a charge but after 2 months it no longer works.  Even after fully charging the right mouse button will work so i know it is connected.  Uninstalled the device, rebooted the laptop and nothing fixed the issue.",43,1.0,2022,04,April,16
Stops working for no reason,5,The USB C adapter is ill fitting and won't keep charging the mouse unless it is held and tilted just so.  Luckily I have another adapter and that is working fine so the mouse itself is good.,37,1.0,2022,04,April,16

Defective from day one,4,"I have had this mouse for almost 2 months, and I use it at least 12 hours a day. I haven't been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging, but in the time I have had it I have only had to charge it 3 times, and I was able to continue to use it while charging.I do use it for gaming, but my games don't require fast and accurate like RPG's etc..so I can say yes, it does gaming for me, but I'm unsure about speed games.Pros:*It's slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it's not ""ergonomically"" built, and it fits nicely in my carry case.*The colors are soothing*You have options for either standard USB or USB-C for chargingThe Cons:*The on/off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole. you need nails or a stylus to turn it on*The sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it ""skates"" over the pad. A good shake usually gets it right.All in all, it's priced reasonably for what you get.**update: like everyone else, just a few days past the 30 day return cutoff my mouse also died. No power, wouldn't charge.. dead. I contacted the Manufacturer MOTOTO INC and they said they have a 1 year warranty on this mouse and they would be happy to send out a new one.",234,1.0,2022,04,April,16

Glitchy and unreliable,3,"OMG! I LOVE this mouse!! It works great with my laptop! I just plug in the little key into the USB port and hello!I REALLY like that it's rechargeable, so saving a ton on batteries. I can't use it while it charging though.The clicks are very quiet, so I don't annoy even myself with the noise. And I love looking at it because of the colors added!! Of course, you can turn off the pulsing colors to save charge, but who would want to??? Unless you needed to...Also, it's a bit small, good for travel, and fits a woman's hand. If you're a man, this mouse may be a bit too small even if it looks cool for gaming.As much as I use my HP laptop, this mouse is a must!Christa",131,1.0,2022,04,April,15

Scroll wheel breaks easily!,4,"Absolute garbage. Listen to the negative reviews and the ones saying the company is spamming them begging to remove their posts. The lights are haywire with no pattern, randomly switching off and on. DPI is NOT adjustable, pretty sure that's a lie. Feels like the lowest grade plastic I've ever felt. Does not track.

So your clicks won't register and the mouse will stop moving across the screen.The added problem is that it gets to this low battery point after about 45min to an hour of use, and then it acts like that for the next several hours. It's nearly impossible to keep it charged up that long.It's a shame because I love how stylized it is. But it's basically unusable.",87,4.0,2022,04,April,11

Works great for general use and battery lasts a while but I haven't done any button mashing games with it. My only complaint is the USB remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage.

Worked well.... until it didn't.,5,"Really liked this mouse for the first week. It then became pretty useless. Tried to recharge, reinstall and all the other hacks. Still won’t accurately track worth beans. Off to the donation pile. Can’t recommend",35,3.0,2022,04,April,05
Okay but.. .,3,"When I got it, I was excited for the USB charging and the cool lights, but this mouse has been a lot of trouble. It will lose connection easily and I'll have to click 4 or 5 times sometimes before actually clicking on what I want.",46,3.0,2022,04,April,05
Got a second one that was junk too,8,"Okay, so, I cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse. My husband is the gamer. I can however, let you know about my general usage opinion...First off, it's pretty. I love the color and I love that it lights up on the sides. There is a setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain. I've been using it for 4 days, pretty consistently and haven't needed to charge it.There wasn't any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used. I just plugged in the small USB and it immediately worked.That's all I can say at this point since I haven't had it that long. I will update this review in a few months and include any issues I may experience and any new opinions I develop...",144,1.0,2022,04,April,05
Works great,2,"I bought this on October 29, 2021 and it stopped working on April 6, 2022. It started acting up on the 5th where the responsiveness was sketchy. I charged it that night and the next day it didn’t power up.",40,5.0,2022,04,April,05

So cute!,2," If you have big hands, I don’t recommend you buying this. Also with the lighting I really dislike it! If you look at the video it goes through the mouse and you can see all the the stuff inside! Very disappointed. Overall, it’s a good and sturdy mouse, just thought they could’ve worked on the exterior more.",57,5.0,2022,04,April,05
Worst Mouse Ever,3,"I'm a teacher so I don't want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day. This mouse keeps a good charge, allows me to walk around my class the whole time- stays attached to me, & the colors just add a bit of fun to it.",50,1.0,2022,04,April,05
It stopped working after 10 months though I didn’t carry it around or used it every single day.,18,I really like this mouse. It's perfect size and I love that it charges. Holds the charge for a long time.,21,1.0,2022,04,April,05
"Cheap quality, not like photos",5,"It is exactly as depicted.  My old mouse just wasn't working correctly, even with a new battery, I was banging on it to get it to respond.  This one is just as advertised, changes colors and responds on just a slight touch.  I LOVE IT !",46,1.0,2022,04,April,05
Okay u get what u pay for,7,"I like the shape and the way the mouse works, unfortunately, I can't even make it through a whole day of work without it needing to be charged again.",29,5.0,2022,04,April,05

Defective and cant return,4,"I loved this mouse--it is super lightweight and the color is lovely. Sometimes I would forget to charge it after a week/week and a half, so that was on me to try to remember. But just yesterday, it stopped charging. Usually the light turns blue when it's charging, which is a great indicator, so I left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop. This morning when I tried to use the mouse, it didn't work. I thought maybe I hadn't plugged it in properly, but just now when I plugged it in (tested out several different USB ports on my laptop), the blue charging indicator light flickered for a second and then went out. It seems that this mouse is not charging anymore, making it basically useless. :(",130,1.0,2022,04,April,03

Colorful paperweight.,2,"I like the feel and look of this mouse. I bought it as a deal of the day. I really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels. I also love that you can recharge it. Only dislike is that I review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something I wasn't trying to type. I'll have to  undo whatever I did. Other than that, good price and quality!",83,1.0,2022,04,April,02
Did not work for me,5,"This mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it.  Not sure what went wrong, but it just gave out and that was it.",29,1.0,2022,04,April,02

Works great,2,Nunca funciono,2,5.0,2022,04,April,01
You get what you pay for!!!,6,"Loved at first. Very cute, loved the scrolling and clicking. Bought for work and used for a couple of weeks and noticed my thumb hurting a lot. Felt like I pulled something in it. Noticed it was worse when using the mouse. Switched to my old mouse that is ergonomic and my thumb is improving. If it’s for minimal use it’s probably ok, but definitely not for daily use at the office",72,1.0,2022,04,April,01
Great Until It Stopped Working,5,"This is for doing school work and casual browsing. Being a gamer, I wouldn't use this for gaming for anyone who is asking, but as a standard wireless mouse it works great with no concerns as of yet. I like that you don't have to replace disposable batteries and it charges quickly via a charging cable that comes with the mouse, as well as instructions (you won't need them as it's very simple to figure it all out). The color changing lights are a nice touch that my 9 year old loves. Would strongly recommend, especially for the price. I enjoy the product so far, especially for school work and internet browsing.",112,2.0,2022,04,April,01
Worthless,1,"I use this mouse for my laptop only when I travel.  After about 3 times using it, the scroll no longer works even when completely charged.  unfortunately with such little use I didn't have much time to notice the defect and the return window has closed.  Wouldn't recommend it.",49,1.0,2022,04,April,01

It's sad a nice item but packaged had no packing material I don't know if it it damaged,18,"As with several other reviews here, the one I purchased lasted several months, until it just stopped tracking mid-swipe.  I thought maybe it just needed a recharge, as that's what it has done in the past when I forgot to charge it overnight... but no, it's more like it just shorted out... works for a swipe and a click and then stops again. Kinda sucks because it's a really cool and fun mouse with the LED lights and the charging vs. batteries. I guess I'll look now to see if the warranty will help a girl out...",97,5.0,2022,04,April,01
meh.,1,"I have only used this a shirt time, it's alright, it does take a minute to get used to the low profile.  My biggest complaint is that it didn't come with a charger as stated.

Great mouse,2,"Unfortunately I missed the return window by less than a month - I do a lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button, and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn't register that I clicked or gets stuck.

I use it a lot, but I bought it literally two months ago.",85,4.0,2022,03,March,31

Worst mouse I've ever purchased.",60,2.0,2022,03,March,31
Sleek mouse that doesn't work.,5,"The fact that it has a quiet mechanism -no sound whatsoever during clicking- was great. But even though I only used it for my desktop computer at work (4-5 days a week), it is not working right now! I did not carry it around or used it for more than a hour during each day, basically because I use my laptop most of time. 10 months is a pretty premature time frame to not function.",75,1.0,2022,03,March,31

Love IT,2,I really like this mouse.  It works great and is really cool looking.  I love the alternating color lights around it and since it's rechargeable you don't have to worry about a short battery life.  I work on my computer 40+ hours a week and I find I only need to charge it every 2-3 weeks.

Mouse speaks for itself,4, At first I really liked this mouse! It was lightweight and had a sleek design. It ended there! Every time I go to use the mouse throughout the day I have to return it on even when it’s already in the on position.

The lights on it still work almost 2 months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into a standard Micro USB cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about 3-5 days.

It worked for a few days and then started having problems. I have to click several times before I can get a response from it. It also barely holds a charge.,59,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Broken,1,It really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in a way. The batter also seems to last quite a few days if you turn it off when it’s not in use. It also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle. The silent clicking is what really gets me.,56,1.0,2022,03,March,21
doesn't work anymore,3,Already stopped working exactly after the return window closed.,9,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Works great with my laptop,5,No need for further comments here. This product will speak for itself,12,5.0,2022,03,March,21
Stopped working after 10 days,5,I really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was. But it only lasted about 8 months before it completely crapped out and never worked again. I suppose it’s a good short term solution.,38,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Not worth the money,4,"It's size is perfect for both travel and for my hands. The LED is a great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my PC. I even bought my mother one, and she loves it too.",40,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Lifesaver!,1,This mouse stopped working not even 3 weeks after I started using it. Not worth it.,16,5.0,2022,03,March,21
Super cute & easy to use,6,"Love this mouse! It’s very smooth and the battery life last pretty long. The led lights are bright but not too distracting if u like to game in the dark like i do. I ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho i wish i could just order that piece. Also if the charger was a bit longer that would be better, i hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range. Other than that it’s a good buy",89,4.0,2022,03,March,21
Super cute & love the LED lights,7,I charged it. It still will not work. The mouse still will not work.,14,4.0,2022,03,March,21
Love it,2,This mouse came in handy when I needed it most after my other one came up missing.,17,5.0,2022,03,March,21
A perfect fit,3,"This product works intermittently. I’ve made sure to charge it, and even with a full charge, it won’t click every time when I try to do so or it will get stuck with and without a mouse pad.",38,5.0,2022,03,March,21
slim,1,Worked great till the roller broke. Used 3 times.,9,4.0,2022,03,March,21
Loved it until is stopped working,6,Not for tablets and won’t accept a return.,8,2.0,2022,03,March,20
Smooth and easy to use.,5,the mouse doesn't use batteries but if you charge it it dies in like an hour. its a piece of crap,21,5.0,2022,03,March,20
Light as a feather.,4,"I love this little mouse! Very well built and sturdy (dropped it twice and nothing happened to it), the colors do not fade, fun lighting, reliable, and very long charging/battery life! I use it almost every day, and haven’t had to charge it in weeks! I ended up buying another one for my daughter, and it’s just as well made!",60,5.0,2022,03,March,20
Charge lasts!,2,I bought 5 months ago and it stopped working. It’s cheap. I suggest not buying this.,16,5.0,2022,03,March,20
Won’t hold a charge,4, Product is not compatible with the the description started for this item. I Will be making sure to get my refund returned.,22,1.0,2022,03,March,20
Works Well,2,"This mouse has a low profile which fits my hand perfectly.  The point glides smoothly over the screen.  I haven't seen any difference in pointer speed between the three DPI settings, but it doesn't matter because it is fast enough.  Can't say enough good things about the fact that this mouse is rechargeable but I have been using it daily for about a week and it shows no sign of running down or needing recharging.  The kaleidoscope effect of changing colors is cool, makes me want to turn out the lights and use the computer in a darkened room.  I would definitely recommend this mouse.",105,5.0,2022,03,March,19
Not worth the money,4,"This is the second mouse I have gone through in less than three months. I ordered the second one on Jan. 30, 2022. I had bought the initial one on Jan. 11, 2022. Today, March 22, mine starting sparking at work and the battery burnt through the wires inside. This could have easily become a horribly DANGEROUS situation!!  That was the second one I bought. The first one, the page scroll/roller ball broke. This also happened to the second one before the battery SPARKED AND BURNT UP WIRES. I am assuming you are a company that values your customers and has a strong moral standing. How do you suggest you resolve this issue?I hope to hear from you soon,Dissatisfied Customer",120,2.0,2022,03,March,19
Long-lasting charge,2,It's nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it's vibrant colors. I got her the mint green one and it works like a champ. I didn't like the feel of a big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn't a problem and likes it so that's the important thing.,55,5.0,2022,03,March,19
Ok,1,Worked great for about 2 weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster.  Now it cannot even hold a charge.  So it now rests in the garbage can.,30,5.0,2022,03,March,19
good value for the price,5,"Really liked the look/feel/quiet click, but it broke on me after a few days!",14,5.0,2022,03,March,19
Cute addition,2,There was no USB C adapter included.  So it’s essentially useless if you need it for a USB C system.,20,5.0,2022,03,March,18
Broke in less than 2 months,6,Horrible,1,2.0,2022,03,March,18

Scroll doesn’t work,3,"Bought to replace older belkin that had no wheel.  I'm trying to learn cad so the wheel is necessary... this Mouse is amazing, i can't believe the cost.  My girlfriend stole it to take to work so I'm ordering another one... very impressed.",43,1.0,2022,03,March,18
Worst mouse I have ever used,6,"It worked great, it would get a little slow when it needed charging but all of a sudden it won't come on even after charging.",25,1.0,2022,03,March,18

"Terrible, Do Not Buy",4,I  LOVED this mouse until the scroll wheel broke a week after the return window. Very disappointed!!,17,1.0,2022,03,March,17
Stops responding even after charging it.,6,I have had this mouse for a while and I have barely used it because the lag is so bad. SO SO SO SO SO BAD. It doesn't follow. It's so slow. It's infuriating. I do graphic work and cannot have a mouse that doesn't act in real time. I do not recommend.,53,1.0,2022,03,March,17
usb broke,2,It broke within 2 days from  falling off a laptop onto table. I've had other computer mice that fell down the same distance all the way up to down the stairs at worknever had an issue do not reccomend,39,3.0,2022,03,March,17
Ok,1,"I bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design. After using it for awhile, I plugged it in a charged it. Worked for awhile, then it would only work for a few hours, then not at all. When I plugged it in, I noticed that I had to move the connection (where it plugs into the device) to the left, then it would light up, but if I let go, nothing.  I would not recommend this product!",80,5.0,2022,03,March,17
It would never charge,4,I really love this little mouse as it is easy to use and I can put it in a safe mode so I don't have to keep recharging it and saving on having to buy batteries. My laptop is used primarily for embroidery files so I don't use it for gaming and can't address that.,55,2.0,2022,03,March,17
Scroll wheel broke after 6 weeks,6,"I just used this mouse for work a few hours a day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when I flipped the switch after just 10 days. I plugged it in to charge like I'd done a few times before and the blue light came on. When the blue light went off I unplugged it and switched it on, but it flashed red a couple of times and wouldn't work. I repeated the process with the same outcome. I know it's a cheap mouse but wow, I got less than one day of use for every dollar I spent.",99,1.0,2022,03,March,17
Worked great for 6 weeks then died,7,I loved the mouse and it worked great for the first couple of weeks. And then the scroll wheel is no longer working.,23,1.0,2022,03,March,17

Breaks super easy,3,The slime design makes it easy to transport. the usb piece fits nicely under neither. When it goes into sleep move just click the button and its back up and running!,31,1.0,2022,03,March,16
Already broken,2,Absolutely loved this mouse. But it stopped working all of the sudden. After reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue. But I guess that's what you get when you purchase something that is only $14. 🤷‍♀️😞,39,1.0,2022,03,March,16
Broken after 1 week,4,It’s very comfortable to use. Minimal noise,7,1.0,2022,03,March,16

Not very Functional,3,I brought this mouse for my work computer and it works well,12,2.0,2022,03,March,16
Lasted ~9 months,3,The mouse is sleek and cool looking especially with the the colors.  But after a few months. It won't hold charge and the input for the charge cable is loose nd won't try charge unless it held in a certain angle nd pushed it with force,46,1.0,2022,03,March,15
Not worth the little bit I paid for it,9,I bought this to use at work as they only provided a wired mouse. I charged it before taking it in and it's been 2 weeks now and I haven't had to recharge it yet. It fits comfortably into my hand and is lightweight.,44,1.0,2022,03,March,15
Love!,1,Great,1,5.0,2022,03,March,15
No batteries required,3,love this mouse. its lightweight and i love that its USB charge. A great value for the price.,18,5.0,2022,03,March,15
Doesn’t work,2,"I got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest. I love the led colors with the mouse although I rarely change the settings. I love that I don’t have to switch batteries and all I have to do plug it in. I could tell after about a week including me leaving my mouse on a few times that it was time for a charge. My mouse began to lag and I went ahead and plugged it up. Also, the color of the mouse matches with the picture well",91,1.0,2022,03,March,15

Don't waste your money,4,"It works great with lighting up, clicking, speed.. the scroll doesn’t work to move the screen up and down.",19,1.0,2022,03,March,14
"CHEAPLY Made, Doesn't Last.",4,"It works okay in the first couple of minutes, and then the cursor starts to jump other than moving smoothly as the mouse moves. Also, clicks often fail to work at the first button down. Sometimes several clicks need to trigger an action. I threw it away and ordered other products.",51,1.0,2022,03,March,14
LAGGY,1,The charge does not last a full day,8,1.0,2022,03,March,14
Perfect for our needs,4,"Well I thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them. However not only do they not maintain a charge WHILE TURNED OFF (I literally have to charge both after one dies, and it's not like these things last that long, so that's pathetic). But also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting, the mouse still will just flash red and not work.I got a 3rd to replace the 2nd, but that one was just as bad. They are all bad. This is a waste of money. You're better off dealing with batteries than these cheap, wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway. Please don't buy, because you will be happy with it right until...the return window closes.",127,5.0,2022,03,March,14

Jumps all over the place,5,Mouse is very pretty aesthetics of it is nice it handles well.  But it broke within a couple days of getting it.  The button stuck. I wouldn’t click anymore.  Unfortunately I liked it so well this was the second one that I ordered and the first one that I ordered the rollerball stopped working but it’s too late to return that one so now I have two broken ones.  The lights on at a really cool the battery lasts really long time in between charging but now I have two of them that have broken and a six week. I think,101,2.0,2022,03,March,13

Worst mouse ever…. Not even 2 months and is already broken,11,"When I bought this mouse, I really liked it. It felt nice, worked well on a consistent basis, and the colors give my desk a pretty touch. It was cheap so I guess you can't expect it to last but I was hoping to get at least a year. After 9 months of light daily use, it doesn't want to charge. Even if I leave it plugged in all night, in the morning it barely has any charge. This is a decent mouse if you don't mind having to buy a new one a couple of times a year but I'm going to just spend a little more and get one that is, hopefully, better quality.",116,1.0,2022,03,March,12

Not a fan,3,I bought this wireless mouse for my classroom so that I could click around on my smartboard without having to walk across the room to my desk each time.

best mouse with style,4,Had it two months and it’s already dead. What a piece of junk. So glad it quit working right after the return window closed. Quit scrolling and moving the cursor on the screen. Cheap piece of garbage.,37,5.0,2022,03,March,06

Don’t recommend,2,"I really like this mouse. It's small and slim, so it doesn't make my wrist sit at a weird angle. It also has a good battery life. I think I've only charged it like once since I bought it several months ago. It's pretty responsive and light, and overall, it's great quality for the money. It does feel a little cheap and fragile because of how light it is, but that doesn't bother me at all.",76,2.0,2022,03,March,06

It's A Party Mouse,4,"Bought this mouse in January and fully charged it the same day i got it. Until this day, as I am writing this review I haven't recharge it not once. I must say I use it a fair amount of time, not to full extent everday but i do use it. I really like the sleep mode, that preserve the battery a whole lot because sometimes i just get up leave it and go out on the road, spend a few hours and come back and it's still here doing great.I feel pretty satisfied, with what I payed for this I didn't expect it to hold up like this but I give thanks...Five stars for this...",116,5.0,2022,03,March,04

Lags,1," This product is not worth the headache. The first mouse stopped scrolling after 2 weeks of use. I returned it and 2 days after using the new mouse I am returning it and requesting a refund.  The mouse doesn't hold a charge because there is a red light around the whole mouse that is always on, EVEN WHEN SWITCHED OFF. The previous mouse wasn't like this and worked well until it stopped scrolling. Now I have to go to a second location to return the mouse again. They should reimburse the gas I've used returning this mouse. I probably spent more in gas than what I paid for the mouse.As you can see in the video, it is off but the light is on. I turn it off and the light on. I then turn it off again and the light doesn't turn off.",144,2.0,2022,03,March,04

Just Right,2,"After receiving this mouse, I charged the mouse per the instructions on a normal rate USB charger (non fast charger). This took a little under two hours for a full charge. The blue light goes out when fully charged.I installed the USB receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on Windows 11. The mouse seems to work smoothly, and the mouse pointer is swift. You can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast. The mouse lights up around the sides when in use, it is a bit quirky but it doesn't bother me. Also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for a certain period of time, probably to prolong the battery charge. To wake the mouse I just move it or press a button.Overall it is a decent wireless/rechargeable mouse.",137,5.0,2022,03,March,01

Comfort,1,"I bought this because I’m trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it’s not worth it. The mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want, like it’s pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this.

Very durable!,2, Its really great I don't use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading. It changes color on its own you can't personally change it that's a bummer. It slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light. When you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors. If your fine with the red light then buy it. Other than that it does its job really pretty too. The mouse is a matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that.,103,5.0,2022,02,February,24

Worked well for a minute,5,"I knew what I was getting myself into reading the bad reviews; it stops working in a few weeks. Usually, I hedge my bets especially when a product has so many reviews that end up with a 4.5 star rating. Alas, I lost this bet. The scroll function, a key feature I look for in buying mice, stopped responding after a a few weeks. A fluke? I should buy a scratcher if so because I bought two, one white, one black, and they both failed around the same time.I’m wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way, though, as I’m seeing many other reviews doing the same thing, but people being bribed for a 5 star, if replaced. Quite genius, actually. If you get angry customers to review, it promotes product engagement, but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting a 4-5 star review. If this indeed is the case, BRAVO. Brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for a subpar product.",171,1.0,2022,02,February,23

"Great, until it broke",4,For the price I realized I could have gotten something a lot better. It’s cheaply made. Glitches even with a full charge. I got the white one and I wish I would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it. It does the job still all considering I just think it’s value is overestimated.,70,1.0,2022,02,February,16

I like it,3,"I needed a mouse for my laptop and so I bought this! The set up was really easy. Simply charge the mouse, plug in the USB and done! The silent clicks are indeed quiet but I wouldn’t say they’re completely inaudible, but that’s totally okay with me! When the mouse charges, it turns blue and when it’s done charging, the light will switch off. When I turn on the mouse to the color mode, the colors fade nicely to the next. The only nitpick for me is that I wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don’t peek through it. But it’s personal preference. I also like how it came with a USB to USBC adapter just in case it needs to be used for a Mac. Overall, a great mouse!",142,5.0,2022,02,February,15

Love this item!,3,"Never buy this product!!!When I buy something, I usually look at product reviews, but this product seems to have a lot of problems, unlike reviews. I don't usually post reviews, but I'm posting this product review in hopes that there won't be victims like me. I bought a mouse and it worked fine at first. But after charging it, it started to get weird and didn't work at all. So I thought there might be a small problem, so I exchanged the new one instead of a refund. Received a new mouse and it worked fine for another few days. But after charging it again, it didn't work. The product user manual says it is sensitive to charging, but this is a serious problem. I bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire, but I think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem.",153,5.0,2022,02,February,14

Perfect Mouse!!!,2,"I recently got a job working from home and needed a mouse to accompany. I purchased the rose gold, it is beautiful, came on time, and hooked up with no issues.

The white little adapter underneath the mouse easily connected to the  black usb that I used for my MacBook to usbc . The white small cable I believe to charge it.

"Very comfortable, efficient mouse",4,"I loved this mouse...for the literal two weeks (14 days) that I had it and it was working.  For no apparent reason, the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working, approximately five seconds after I had last used it.  I had not subjected it to  any pressure, or abuse of any sort.  I was looking at a document, scrolled down, continued reading, tried to scroll down and...nope.  In the lower ratings, this seems to be a common problem.  I'm bummed, I really did love the mouse. :(",86,5.0,2022,02,February,12

It was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were a nice, though not necessary, feature. I received it in September. It wasnt something I used every day, about once or twice a week.

Garbage,1,"This was a good mouse I got as a gift and I really liked it until it didn’t work anymore! After a while it stoped working and I looked at some other reviews that said they got a defective one, well I guess I did and they are kinda common to be defective so I would only risk buying it if you want the mouse a decent amount. I would say you’re chance of it being broken is like a 3/10. Also, it only stops working after like 4/5 days so you won’t know until then if you buy it…  Also I did like that they added a usb-c adapter in the box. I use they adapter for something else now.",121,1.0,2022,02,February,10

Disappointed,1,The color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty. The scroll wheel on the mouse is made from a cheap rubbery/silicone material and is completely crooked. It also did not have a good feel when testing it out - not smooth and feels like it take a lot of extra pressure to operate than others. Not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned.,81,3.0,2022,02,February,10

Great product!,2,"I bought this product in November, by December the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped. I’ll admit I liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again….here we are in February and the same exact thing has happened again. I used this mouse for my work computer in the office, and certainly don’t aggressively use the scroll wheel. Yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units, both within the first 6 weeks of use. I’ve never had a mouse break apart like this before, so I have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together. I suppose you get what you pay for, a shame because aesthetically it is very nice.I will never buy this product again, I would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away. Pay a few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than a few weeks.Side note: I look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review (rolls eyes).

Garbage,1,"I would have loved this product if my hands weren’t so picky, and plus it was a bit too flat for gaming on a pc. Works fine very silent clicks, still if you aren’t used to a flat mouse don’t buy it",42,1.0,2022,02,February,01
"White is basically translucent, but is also why I got it.",11,I liked the unit until it stopped functioning.,8,5.0,2022,02,February,01
Only month old and doesn't work.,6,"PROS- wireless ease of use- feels nice: soft, smooth, sleek- dampened click, quietCONS**- It has a very loud scroll button - the wheel works fine, but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud, so it slightly defeats the purpose of a quiet mouse.- no additional buttons such as ""back"" or ""forward""ADDITIONAL- you have to charge the mouse with the included USB charger",66,1.0,2022,02,February,01
Not a good item or warranty,6,Stopped working already!,3,2.0,2022,02,February,01
PRODUCT SUCKS,2,I never had a wireless mouse before and wow! I’m blown away that the chord had been cut and I’m free to have total control from such a great distance.

Great mouse for the price,5,"Had it for only one day until I accidentally dropped it from less than a meter, and the stroller wheel broke. I could fix it with superglue but come on, I shouldn't have to do that. It was cheaply made and it literately broke day 1. If you're thinking of buying this don't let me stop you from trying it, just don't drop it.",64,4.0,2022,01,January,31

Great mouse for the price,5,"I had this mouse for about a week, I use it for work and once it died i used the cable it came with to charge it. I left it plugged in for a few hours and now it wont turn on at all. It flashes red and turns off. Waste of money",53,5.0,2022,01,January,30

works well,2,The first mouse lasted 2 months and bought the same mouse to replace it.  It died within a day of using it.  Buy cheap - get cheap.  Not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for a refund.  The first one worked great and had a satisfying button click... a shame it didn't last very long.,60,4.0,2022,01,January,29

Great product,2,"Very light weight and comfortable to use for basic computer tasks.  It was also very easy to set up, took less than 2 minutes as it came charged. Also the Vitter life has been great so far only needing to charge 1 time in the 2 weeks of having the item.",51,5.0,2022,01,January,29
2 months later and already broken,6,After looking at the reviews of this particular LED mouse I decided to give it a try. I received it and so far I am very pleased with how it performs.

It broke right away,4,"So disappointed. This promised to be a cute and functional mouse. But it never worked. Not even for a day. Charged it, followed all directions (I am tech proficient) and it wouldn’t even turn on. Feels cheap too so I’m not surprised. So disappointing to purchase things that don’t work.

Not good,2,"I bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of a pain to use.

"I dropped on the carpet floor for the first time , and it broke .",15,"I had to update my review because I initially gave it only one star. It abruptly stopped working after 2 months BUT I realized the following day that it was actually a problem with my Mac or WiFi instead of the mouse. When I attempted to print, my Mac was also not “finding” my printer. Ooops. So, I shut down my Mac, my printer, my WiFi and when I turned everything back on, all was well. Not sure which thing caused the problem, but happily, my mouse is working fine again. No one contacted me to change my review. I was not offered anything. As a business owner, I understand how important reviews are, so when something turns out differently… we need to update our review. It’s the right thing to do.",132,2.0,2022,01,January,26

Love this mouse!,3," I needed a new cheap mouse (and this was on sale) and read through a lot of reviews. I saw a lot of reviews stating that there was a chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white, allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top. Well, that sounded cool to me, so I ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same. I'm pleased to report that it does!So be warned that ordering the white version has a chance to do this, and apparently often. I find it fun though. I'm also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse, so when not in use, it will conserve it's battery power by turning off. Clicking with the mouse will turn it back on. Battery life has been good so far too. I work from home for 8hrs a day, and it survives my work day easily. I just plug it up to charge after work.",167,5.0,2022,01,January,26
Cute But Didn't Last,4,"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. I have tried keeping it plugged in, restarting my computer and trying the mouse on a different computer and it still doesn't work. And now, of course, it's passed the time to return or get a refund. Even though it's a cute mouse, it doesn't work and I'm frustrated. :(",70,2.0,2022,01,January,26
love it,2,"This mouse is lightweight, easily connects and transports well for those on the go. It being rechargeable means no searching for batteries and the feel of the mouse is comfortable and not bulky. The lights are fun and you have the option to turn that on or off. All in all this is a great mouse with great value for the cost!",62,5.0,2022,01,January,20
New mouse for laptop.,4,Nice mouse responds well works great with my windows 11 laptop battery life is fair haven’t had it long so far it’s been good will update,26,5.0,2022,01,January,06
Mouse moves smoothly!,3,"I purchased this little over 6 months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop, so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking.  Immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than 2 than 2 “weekend” days so I started turning it off. About 3 months later I noticed lagging in click response.. soon after, clicks were not engaging.. I replaced it with brand name (you get what you pay for).. but I thought I should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement… it’s been over 2 weeks now and no response. I do not recommend this product or its manufacturer. Beware!!",111,5.0,2022,01,January,25

Macbook adapter faulty,3,Good looking and works great. Love the changing lights.,9,2.0,2022,01,January,25
Don’t buy! Short term mouse.,5,"Haven't done many reviews but think this one was worth the time. I have hands that are a bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm. Very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area. Haven't used the mouse for gaming but also haven't had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too. Overall if you are looking for a wireless mouse, good for work and home use with good connectivity, I'd highly recommend this mouse.",95,1.0,2022,01,January,25
Constant issues,2,"I bought this mouse thinking it would be a good mouse for my Mac. When i opened it it took many attempts to connect, and then it kept draining all of its battery every night.

Only worked for 3 months,5,Love it and works great. Good purchase.,7,1.0,2022,01,January,25
died within a month of using,6,My boyfriend got me this as a gift to help with my crafting! I love this color because it goes with my cricut. I also LOVED that it came with an adapter for my MacBook Air. These newer MacBooks require adapters for anything that is not a charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is AMAZING! I don’t have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use. Love it!! Thank you so much for thinking of us Apple users!!,90,1.0,2022,01,January,24
Quit working after 1 month,5,"Great mouse for the price. Nice and soft matte feel. Very quite clicks, perfect for working in a coffee shop. Works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces. And connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software. NOTE: RGB lights are not customizable. But still cute as heck and works great!",56,1.0,2022,01,January,24
LED Wireless Mouse,3,"The pros:Decent mouse for what I needed. I like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging.The cons:These first two are mostly preferences, so take them however you wish. It sits fairly flat so there isn't much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in a mouse. This just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences. Secondly, it has a silent, soft click. Normally when you click a mouse, you feel and hear the click of the button. This feels more like I am pressing on a touch screen. There is no satisfying click nor is there a sudden give in the button, rather it feels like I'm poking a couch cushion. This could be what you want in a mouse, so do with this info what you will.This last con is not based on preferences however. I found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when I am moving the mouse to the right. With the dual screens I have this means that I end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close a tab, or select a tool in my Adobe programs. It's nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile, but it was enough to stand out and earn it's place in this review.",259,5.0,2022,01,January,24
It lights up pretty…,4,"6 months into using this mouse, it can't stay charged and can barely track.  It works okay (still doesn't track well) when plugged in, but I wanted a cordless mouse for a reason.  Definitely don't recommend this one!!",38,2.0,2022,01,January,24
Don't trust it on your apple products,7,Works great. Was a gift for my mom. She loves it,11,1.0,2022,01,January,23
"Bought in late Nov, stopped working January.",7,"It's a really nice everyday mouse. The sleep mode is a little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it.I don't think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing, but it's great for office use.",53,1.0,2022,01,January,23
My cat bought this,4,The mouse had come in a greasy package and had already been opened before I opened it myself. It had brown and black stains all over the top of the mouse and was of horrible quality. Would not recommend it to anyone looking for a mouse.,46,5.0,2022,01,January,23

Cool !,2,Does not work,3,5.0,2022,01,January,22
It stopped working after 1 month.,6,"If you want a cheap light-up mouse then get this one when it’s on sale, definitely not worth the $21 price otherwise. It’s very quiet and slim, but that’s about where the benefits outweigh the cost. The actual lighting is not what’s advertised, it’s actually pretty dim even in a dark room. Beyond that, whenever you move the mouse, the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse, taking over the other colors being displayed. Additionally, with the 2 hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity, you’d be better off buying a nicer mouse for the same price",105,1.0,2022,01,January,22

Didn’t work,2,"I liked it a lot for the first few days - I mean, it’s a cheap mouse, but it was pretty decent. On day 3, it just stopped working. No amount of charging would turn that sucker back on.

Brilliant Mouse,2,"This mouse is true to its description in that it's silent and ergonomic, but it wasn't worth the money for me--I bought it in April 2021, and had to throw it out in January 2022. Around November of 2021, I started experiencing issues with charging, where I'd have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging. By January, it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable, but with the charging port in the mouse. It was loose and wiggly when I held the mouse up, and it would only charge if I held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a cute mouse.",120,5.0,2022,01,January,18

"Cute, didn't last long",4,"At first I loved this mouse. The charging time is short, the lights are nice and it worked perfectly. The adapter never worked but I looked past it since I bought a USB adapter for my Mac. Now the mouse acts like it’s dying and won’t have a good connection. It now will not charge properly. I’m so disappointed because I initially loved it. I’ve only had it since a little under a month ago. I’m so upset I wasted my money on this.

Good mouse for the money,5,"Super sad because I was obsessed with this mouse but it has already stopped working after one month. Super frustrating, should had just gone to Best Buy originally.",28,4.0,2022,01,January,13
Good quality,2,For one this mouse is not compatible with the c adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device. Update it and see why the c adapter isn't working or remove this item.,37,5.0,2022,01,January,13
Not great,2,"Nice looking mouse, beautiful colors, and comfortable hold for any sized hands.The battery on this thing is surprising, charging does take time, but seriously, that won't be a problem because this thing can last long.I do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn't drain, sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won't get caught off guard for when It does lose battery.",69,3.0,2022,01,January,13
Dead after two weeks,4,"I followed instructions for charging and tried a few different methods, but could never get this to power on or work. The company was great to quickly refund it, though.",30,1.0,2022,01,January,13
Awesome,1,The mouse falls asleep right away. The cord for recharging is only about 4 in 5 in long. Constantly needs to be recharged.  It is definitely not a five-star product.It looks cool.,32,5.0,2022,01,January,12
More Chinese Junk,3,"Be ready to turn it on and off every 2 mins of non-use, the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it.  not something I would reccomend",35,1.0,2022,01,January,12

Infant Mortality,2,"It's a cute mouse, I like the colors, and it's ergonomic. However, I've only had it for a little over 6 months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working. I've never had that happen with a mouse, so it's not the best quality in the world.",49,1.0,2022,01,January,12
Daughter Loved It,3,"This mouse will randomly move the cursor all over the screen every once in a while. Not going to bother returning it because it was so cheap, but I have stopped using it. I bought two and they both have this issue.",42,5.0,2022,01,January,11

Amazing Rechargable Wireless Mouse,4,The crazy mouse will not hold a charge. I have to plug it in after 30 minutes of use. Defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. My alkaline battery mouse would last for months and then just a simple battery replacement. Do not buy!,44,5.0,2022,01,January,11
Stopped working,2,Comfortable to use,3,1.0,2022,01,January,10

Thank you seller for the quick delivery and aftersale communication...",57,1.0,2022,01,January,09
Excellent investment for the price!,5,The micro-USB to USB-C adapter does not work. You are better off ordering a mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth (that does not need a receiver),30,5.0,2022,01,January,09
Easy to use,3,"Once I got this product I read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse, and it will not work!

Wish I could return! Ugh!,5,This mouse works really well. The only thing is I don’t feel like the battery lasts very long. I use it for work and those are 8 hour days of non stop computer work. I only get about 4-5 days of use before I have to recharge again.,48,1.0,2022,01,January,09

Faulty Basil??,2,"Works well , but son broke within a week.  Dropped it and it shattered.",14,1.0,2022,01,January,09
Light weight and battery life is great I love it,10,"Loved the product look and that it was rechargeable, however the battery didn’t hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via Bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. Also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use. Returning item and going back to Logitech brand.",71,5.0,2022,01,January,09
Excellent.. but,2,I bought this for home office and I liked it so much I bought a second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me.  It’s everything the description says it is.  Very comfortable too!,39,5.0,2022,01,January,09

Does not work,3,"I bought this mouse for college and I received it promptly. I opened the package and plugged it into my computer and it worked kinda.

Mouse,1,"I'm so happy that I purchased this mouse. It's sleek and it's easy to use. I enjoy the light component, it adds uniqueness. The mouse is light weight. The USB chip is easy to keep up with because it fits in a small space underneath the mouse. That way the chip never gets lost. I also like the idea that I can charge the mouse and I never have to worry about an internal battery malfunctioning. I highly recommend this mouse for purchase.",83,5.0,2022,01,January,07
Uncomfortable,1,"Has worked well for over a year now (bought 10/2020). Light still glows, no issues with the function. I don't game or anything so it's had light use. It has a surprising amount of battery.",35,1.0,2022,01,January,06

I have two of these and both have issues with the DPI randomly changing itself so I have to click the button to change it numerous times a day. Every now and then the one I use at home doesn't 'connect' when turning on the computer. I have to unplug/re-plug the dongle. I do have it plugged into a USB switch, but seeing as it's the only device that encounters this issue I don't believe the problem is the switch. Not likely to buy this again, it's been too frustrating.",96,5.0,2022,01,January,06

Charging port broke,3,"I got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the PC.

All around great purchase,4,I purchase this mouse for my kid. He had an old one using batteries only. He is frustrated by replacing batteries so frequently (every 2 weeks).

Spend the money on a different brand this was like ordering from wish.",73,5.0,2022,01,January,03
Stopped working after 1 month of use,7,"Fits in my big hands nicely, with the mouse wheel having a non sleep feel.I bought two of these, one for my work laptop and one for my personal laptop.

great mouse!,2,Sorry. Usually I dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake. It started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked.

Don’t buy!,2,"Small, lightweight yet firm solid feel. Led lighting is a nice touch. Shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown. However the main reason I purchased was because of the silent feature. Sadly it's not as silent as I had hoped. Clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing. Why cant someone make a truly silent mouse? I have yet to find one as most ""silent"" mice are merely muffled by a rubber lining. Shame, would be perfect otherwise",83,1.0,2022,01,January,02
It stopped working after one charge use.,7,"This was my second purchase. I bought one in June and it worked fine. The charging port metal ""liner"" part fell out, so it couldn't be charged.

Great mouse,2,"Mouse doesn't track well.  It's also really flat and doesn't feel good in my hand. Wish it had a battery, rather that cord, or at least a battery backup.

Junk,1,"Overall, I really liked the mouse. I enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice. The main problem I had is that I specifically bought it for work for my Mac laptop. The adapter didn't work at all. I had to keep holding it down at a specific angle in order to use it at all. Very disappointing......",61,5.0,2021,12,December,23
Good Mouse,2,"I only used this mouse for a short while, but it works very well. I was able to connect it using the USB transmitter very easily.  It does what it is supposed to do",34,4.0,2021,12,December,22
Cool little mouse,3,"When I bought it expecting it to last more than a month, then last week I noticed something wasn't right.

Great for a laptop,4,"The color is spot on.It is ergonomic and more flat than arched.Sometimes I think it is too wide, but yet it's not.The price was right, the color choices were great.Overall happy that I found this mouse.It was for my Apple laptop as it didn't have one and  hated not having a mouse to navigate",54,5.0,2021,12,December,22

Very Nice,2,"I'm happy with my purchase! It wasn't an expensive mouse, it's wireless and rechargeable, all things I was looking for. It is a slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to. I only use it for office work tasks so I can't speak to other uses. However I don't notice any lags, delays or other issues. I do wish there was some way to control the colors but it's not a big deal. Also the top clear button clicks but I haven't figured out what that does.",91,5.0,2021,12,December,22

Wtf,1,I loved this mouse until it stopped working after about a month of use. It is plugged in and charging but is not responding to movement after about ten minutes.

Received: 12/4/21; RIP 12/20/21,4,I purchased this with the hope to use it for my home office to get rid of my corded mouse.

Cheap Product,2,"I bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked.  I love the feature of charging them by USB in place of batteries.  So much more convenient.

What I expected,3,"I was searching for Bluetooth mouse. I found one, but didn't like the color. When I changed to the silver one, some how it switched off of Bluetooth.It is wireless and did work with the USB dongle.The buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth.Unfortunately I have a MAC and the USB ports are only USB-C.

Terrible mouse,2,"When I received this product the first time, it had come broken. The entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn’t easily be snapped back into place. I sent in for a replacement and everything was all fine! They sent a replacement no problems. This was in April.Flash forward to December, a mere eight months. The mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now 100% useless, which makes playing games a bit difficult, as many games use the scroll wheel. When to contact customer service? All contact is closed.Use caution when ordering this mouse. At first, the replacement I had been sent was good, despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged; but if the scroll wheel’s mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions? Perhaps pass for something more heavy duty.",154,1.0,2021,12,December,18

Waste your money elsewhere,4,I love this mouse. It has a cute and ergonomic design and doesn’t need to be charged often. The only thing I don’t like about the matte black one is that it shows fingerprints easily.,35,1.0,2021,12,December,17

I’m not happy with it!,5,"Not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse I have ever had the displeasure of holding, the USB type C adapter is a loose fitting piece of junk.  Not even worth the hassle of returning.  This piece of garbage only flashes red for a second then quits doing anything else (even after being charged for 8 hours).  I have attached it to 4 different devices and nothing.  I guess you get what you pay for and I this instance...JUNK",80,1.0,2021,12,December,17

P.o.s,1,"My previous mouse wheel stopped working. I love the shape, slim design of this mouse. The lights are pretty cool. It is so nice, if I forget to turn off, it goes to sleep. Very reactive. It is a Perfect replacement.UPDATE: only lasted 2 months. Now the pointer is not controllable. I have tried everything I can think of. Thought it was my laptop. Started using computer pad and the issue is not there. It is the mouse. Very disappointed so I am changing my review.",86,1.0,2021,12,December,16

Nice feature to have.",71,5.0,2021,12,December,15

Junk mouse.,2,"Mouse is nice, I thought there was an option to not have it light up since I don't need that function but the 3 options are off, one color, and alternating many colors. It only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still. Glides good, clicks well. My only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be a little unreliable, if i want to scroll down just a line or two it won't move and then if i scroll just a little faster it zooms down the page. Overall decent",99,1.0,2021,12,December,15

Switched back to battery operated Bluetooth mouse.Worked well for the time being. I bought 2 and the other is still working, for now. As of now, I've tried to use it on notebook, tablet, and desktop to ensure it's a connection issue. Maybe it's the battery, but I'm not sure. If sleep mode is active, the battery shouldn't be having issues in such a brief time of having it. It should last a few days after a full charge (overnight).",103,5.0,2021,12,December,15
got the Mac version and it stopped working after my second use,12,Love the mouse my only downfall is that it’s very light and I’m used to a little heavier one so it’s something to get used too.,26,1.0,2021,12,December,15
This Mouse is FANTASTIC!!!,4,1,1,5.0,2021,12,December,15
Broke the first week,4,The mouse no matter how much I charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer. I normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money I spent on this. All I wanted was a mouse to help me work on my Macbook and this was just a huge disappointment.,58,1.0,2021,12,December,15
buena compra.,2,"I purchased this to replace a broken battery operated cordless mouse.  I think I dropped it one too many times. I thought I would give this rechargeable mouse a try. I hope that I won't have to recharge it too often.  I only had to do the initial charge so far, and I do a lot of clicking. I also chose this one for its flatter design.  My other one was higher, and after using it a long time my hand got stiff.  Maybe this one won't do that. So far it hasn't.",93,5.0,2021,12,December,15

It’s just fine,3,"So... my review after using this mouse for 2 months:- there are a lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another- the mouse STOPS WORKING in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged. You have to turn off the mouse, put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again. I will not recommend this mouse to ANYONE!!!!- Couple days later... the mouse has completely stopped working and there's no customer service response.Update: The mouse is still not working. I have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company, but they don't respond. The quality of customer service: 0.Update 2. It’s been over 8 months since I got the replacement… even the replacement is horrible. It stops responding. The action time is delayed. When you left click… it doesn’t respond. This is even after I carefully keep the mouse.",158,3.0,2021,12,December,15
"Worked great, until it didn't.",5,I have had this mouse for a while now. I love it! It's perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part. I don't have to recharge it everyday but I really only use it for work. so I work an 8 hour day again it really doesn't need to be charged often. When it's time for a charge the color will start to shift to red. Everyone that's seen it has asked where I got it and that they want one!,84,1.0,2021,12,December,15
Doesn't Work,2,I bought 2 of these back in October for me and my mom. After a month and and a half of regular use for mine it no longer works.

Worked great. . . for two weeks,7,"This mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and a half. At two weeks, it seemed to glitch. The cursor would jerk and freeze.

Garbage.,1,"I thought I was getting a better mouse by splurging on the more expensive option, but I guess that doesn't seem to matter.I would think I'd get a decent working product for 13 bucks but I guess that also doesn't seem to be a thing.Save yourself the trouble of thinking this is quality product and actually buy a mouse that works.

"Love this mouse, so smooth!",5,"I was a bit skeptical about it being a “quiet” clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet. The clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the…click. My only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly.The lights are enjoyable but don’t display a constant stream of colors as they forcibly/manually change when moved or clicked. They otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle.Overall, it’s a really nice mouse to buy and use. Comfortable and light—kind of reminds me of the Apple mouse.",90,4.0,2021,12,December,13
not great,2,"I loved this mouse.  I used it for a few hours of office work once every week or two.  So very light use in the scheme of things for a computer mouse.

A mouse to enjoy,4,The mouse worked adequately when it arrived.  After a couple weeks it started going through periods where the sensor was unresponsive one minute and then worked fine the next.  At this point its mostly unusuable.  It has an annoying habit of losing connection and suddenly staring straight up while gaming.  Makes fast paced competitive games nearly impossible.Waste your money on some other brand's piece of junk mouse.,67,5.0,2021,12,December,12

Well, if this could be a negative star rating I would do it. If you stop moving the mouse for 10 seconds or more, you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn't respond to your movements.

USB is cheaply made and does not fit in usb ports!!,11,"This mouse is super clean-looking and connects fast. It not only recharges within 2 hours, but it lasts a long time. I've been using it pretty frequently for the past week and only charged it once. It's still going strong. I love how it lights up and it can be used on a mac or windows computer. Very light and easy to transport as well.",65,1.0,2021,12,December,10
Sleek and efficient,3,"I initially loved this mouse. I liked the fact I could recharge it instead of batteries. However after the first week, it just stopped working. I have recharged it and still nothing.",32,5.0,2021,12,December,09

Nice,1,Love this product. Working from home and love the color! Works great,12,5.0,2021,12,December,09
Easily breaks,2,I like this mouse because of the LEDs and the color. But the USB converter that it comes with is not reliable. I had to use a different one in order for the mouse to be usable. I have also noticed sometimes a lag in clicks so I wouldn’t suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise,64,1.0,2021,12,December,09
Cheaply Made,2,"I bought this mouse in April 2021.  I liked it a lot for 8 1/2 months.  For the last few weeks, it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about a half hour.  Even if I try to use it plugged into the computer, it stops tracking and the lights dim.  I can't find any warranty information on it.  I feel like it should have lasted more than 9 months.  I think I'll buy a wireless mouse with a known brand name and hope for better luck.",89,2.0,2021,12,December,09
very nice mouse,3,"Its just literally not working at all. I charged it for three hours and connected the USB to the adapter and plugged it in to my MacBook and it just does not work. I have turned it on and off, put the USB back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work. Instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off.",73,5.0,2021,12,December,09
The Mouse Clicking is very quiet.,6,"First purchase, I received the wrong color. They switched it out no problem. Second mouse came, and it stopped working within two -three weeks. Because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing. Disappointed it stopped working so soon.",46,5.0,2021,12,December,09
It’s twitchy,2,I get so many compliments in the office about my mouse. It’s a huge hit in the office and now 4 coworkers own it in different colors,27,1.0,2021,12,December,08
Not incredibly durable,3,I purchased this mouse for using with MacBook pro 2021. There is no lag while using it and is compatible with MacBook.,22,2.0,2021,12,December,08
Convenient Light Mouse,3,"Okay, I understood that having a mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life; I just didn’t expect THIS. The mouse seems to have no sleep mode (the lights stay on unless it’s completely switched off), and the battery lasts less than two days, brand new. I thought to myself that I could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night, because I do like how the mouse feels and works ... except last night I plugged it in, and this morning, 10 hours later, it WASN’T DONE CHARGING. I have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless mouse in the first place, and ties up two USB ports instead of just one. Shame. Back to the drawing board on my mouse search.",149,5.0,2021,12,December,08

Awesome pretty lights,3,This is a great cordless mouse. It is rechargeable as long as the computer is on.  There is a place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer.  If dropped it will come apart.  Unfortunately it does fly in a special education classroom.  A stronger shell would be great. Also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one.,64,5.0,2021,12,December,03

Very nice wireless mouse,4,"If you are like me and have trouble using USB to USB-C converters (somehow I always end up with flaky ones that don't maintain a connection) be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support USB-C. It comes with a USB and USB-C adapter, however you have to plug the USB-C into the USB adapter to use it. You cannot use the USB-C adapter on its own. Which means I have a 2"" long, double adapter sticking out of my computer, just waiting to get knocked off.

It charges by plugging it into the laptop but I haven’t had to do that yet besides giving it a full charge when I opened it up the first time. It does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took a minute to figure out but once you realize that it’s not broken, just asleep, it’s all good! Overall it’s just a basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable.",104,1.0,2021,12,December,02
Pretty cool,2,I really like this mouse for work. I use mine all day I charge it on Wednesday mid week and leave it charging Friday over the weekend. Works completely fine. I'm coming back and buying two more. I had to come buy more because I dropped mine and it cracked open that's the only reason why. Not because it stopped working but because I broke mine so this time in also getting a backup! My work laptop is a Mac and I'd rather much buy this mouse than the expensive Apple one.,92,5.0,2021,12,December,02
Clicks and works well,4,"The idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun.

Love this!!,2,"And it's only wireless half the time. The other half you'll have it plugged in and charging because a charge doesn't last very long. That's why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse. That makes it hard to use when charging. Everyone knows it's easier to drag a chain up a hill than to push it up. Well, everyone but these people.Update - the battery has completely gone dead. It won't even take a charge anymore after only three months. You have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times, and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast. You have to wait 10 to 20 seconds for it to ""charge"" just so you can use it for another 5 seconds. It's even worse than the 2 star rating I gave it originally.",151,5.0,2021,12,December,01

As described,2,The mouse is slim and lightweight. I love the way that the inbuilt LED light in the mouse changes its colors. It is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop.  The day I bought the mouse I have been using it without charging the battery for 15 days.

Does not fit laptop,4,I had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just 3 weeks. I would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen. Every task on the computer began to take 4x's the amount of time it used to. I had to resort to using the trackpad on my Macbook which I'm not a fan of. Definitely don't get this mouse. Not worth it.,81,1.0,2021,11,November,19

I literally only used it about 5-6 times since buying it and when I put it on the charger this last time, it just completely stopped working. The charger light wouldn't come on and it wouldn't charge. I even switched USBs to see if it maybe had a short in the wire, and still nothing.Now that I'm reading other reviews, I see the problem.

Garbage. Stopped working after a month,6,"You get what you pay for.  Noted.I have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what i want, on any button on it. It is so frustrating and i find myself wishing i would have spent more for a quality product, which i may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it.  It is so cheaply made (plastic all around) i wonder how this can justify a price of over $5.  JMO. Others seem to like it. It just was not what i am looking for. I used it as replacement to my iMac mouse (circa 2012) which finally died. I miss the magic mouse but not $79 worth. Lol im going to have to find a happy medium. This mouse doesn't get it. At all.Only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable.",142,1.0,2021,11,November,17

Not quality,2,"UPDATE 12/6/21:Seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so. I expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery. They even went as far as sending me a “here’s how to remove” link.Purchased this as an upcoming Christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now. The box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday. Let me just say, I am glad that I did.While the mouse powered on and worked fine with the USB dongle that it requires be plugged in to use, I decided to test it's other feature of being able to charge it while using it. Everything worked fine UNTIL I UNPLUGGED IT. Once I unplugged the micro-usb cable from the mouse my entire PC turned OFF. I thought maybe it was just a fluke so I tested it again. Nothing happened the second time so I plugged it back in for a little bit to make sure it had a full charge on it for her, and when I unplugged it to re-package it, it happened again. As to say I am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective.Moral of the store, don't buy cheap products.",254,1.0,2021,11,November,16

The mouse, will go into a sleep mode when you aren't using it, or you can turn it off and on easily.Perhaps the only con is that it doesn't come with instructions.Absolutely, love this mouse and I highly recommend it!!",100,5.0,2021,11,November,15

Great,1,This does not fit on my laptop.  The part that fits into the laptop to make the mouse work did not fit.,22,5.0,2021,11,November,09
Nice,1,"First off I love the color, it’s what made me purchase it in the first place. I didn’t need a mouse, but I like having a spare.Now for my review, as far as what I’m used to for comfort, this mouse sits FLAT. So be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time. Fits nicely in your hand, I have medium small hands, so please take that into consideration with the review.The lights, I loved the different light modes, it actually made it feel like I had a $150 gaming mouse, while not being so hard on my wallet.Now for push button response… my right click wasn’t working properly, barely clicked down and would sometimes Mia click from it being mispositioned. I had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad. I broke it off and now it is clicking as intended. So please be aware, this is all VERY fragile plastic within its housing.Overall the mouse is great if you need a spare, and I would buy again if I needed another. I hate out of 5 stars, because 4/5 feels worse than 8/10…but I feel an 8/10 is more accurate to how I feel, as it has a lot of great features, such as charging vs batteries (and an included usb-c adapter). Overall a wonderful product that I do recommend",233,5.0,2021,11,November,09
Two strikes are enough.,4,I thought this mouse was really cool. But then it broke. The scrolly wheel thing doesnt move anymore. It lasted like a week. And its not my main computer so it didnt get used much in that week.,38,1.0,2021,11,November,09

Not good second one I bought it quit working after a week,12,"I needed a wireless mouse for my new MacBook Pro that only has USB-C connections.  This mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard USB Bluetooth receiver to be used in the USB-C port.  I have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far, but it seems very responsive and performed well.  The led lights are kinda cool, but not really needed.  I'm trying to see if there is a way to use the mouse without the led lights on so I can conserve the charge on the battery.  The only concern/issue I've had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don't seem to be the most secure, and a couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging.  I was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the USB-C port as recommended in the user manual.  The user manual specifically recommends NOT using a plug-in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it.  It is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse.  I'm not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if I continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse.  We'll see how it goes in the future.  If it turns out that it was operator error, I may update my rating.Overall, though, the mouse feels good in my hand, and it seems to work well, doing everything necessary when I need it.",281,1.0,2021,11,November,09

Really enjoyable to use,4,"Just by the Logitech and skip the ""savings"" from this cheap import.  I bought this to replace a wired mouse on my kvm switch and it worked great... for two months.  Would plug in to charge (using an open USB port on my switch was super convenient), turning it off every night while it charged.  The next day, unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly, and I was able to use for the whole day 8-10hrs no problem.  Then, about two weeks ago, same usual routine, go to use the next day and completely dead.  Revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch (4hrs later), swap back out... lights come on for about 10 seconds and again: completely dead.Now I'm out of the return policy not even 6 months later and screwed.",142,5.0,2021,11,November,07
Didn’t work out the BOX!!!,5,"I ordered this mouse because I was tired of using my laptops track pad at school. It arrived on time, charges quickly, has a very satisfying and quiet mouse click sound and overall is a great mouse for the price. The only issue I face is that the RGB on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well. It doesn't prevent the mouse from doing its job though and I often find myself using the mouse with the RGB off anyway.

Messed up ALL my mice,5,"So we’ve gone thru quite a few wireless items over the last few years. This one by far has knocked it out of the park. I actually allowed my 9 year old to pick her mouse this year (she’s 9) and she picked based on color. I read the description. The review’s were good and the price was right so we hit “buy now”. I love sleep mode, I really love that it’s rechargeable, battery lasts weeks. I like that it lights up when it’s charging and let’s you know when it’s done. And an added bonus: it’s the cutest shade of baby pink.",104,1.0,2021,11,November,04
Great deal,2,"This product does what I need it to do, and does it perfectly. I'm super picky about stuff, and I can honestly say I am very well pleased. I do believe I have to turn it off for a moment when it hibernates, but that is whatever to me. Haha",50,4.0,2021,11,November,03
Two Months Later - No Longer Works Properly,8,"Wireless mouse went out ordered this one. Arrived early. Feels good in hand, easy to control. The lights are ""cute"" as they change colors lol.

Sleek but frustrating,3,"This is a nice, sleek little mouse. I'm very pleased with the size and the connection/range. I was looking for one that wasn't too clunky but still looked decent. This definitely fits the bill. All the awesome colors is just a plus for my own personal amusement, also if you don't want the lights all the time there is a setting for that too. Good little mouse for the price.",70,2.0,2021,11,November,03

Soft and Smooth Mouse Device,5,"The first one had a defective charging cord connector (very loose,) and the replacement sent promptly starts fine and gets steadily slower and more and more draggy and must be turned off and on again to start working normally.  Both were returned under warranty and won't be reordered again.  Neat but not good quality.",54,5.0,2021,11,November,03

That it works,3," I rely really love this. I bought it few months ago and I wanted to give a review after some time. I am this every single day, all the day and with the lights on. It has 2 functions,... The first one is like On, snf the second is with lights. I love it, I charge it once every few weeks and it is so silent, I can use it doing my studies till midnight, no problem with the clicking. I can charge it with the USB, so I don't have to change a battery. After few months, my mouse is working sooo good and if it is not charged, then I can connect to USB and continue to work with it. Good investment!",124,1.0,2021,11,November,02

broken in less than 2 months,6,I have used this mouse for two weeks now and it is now not working properly. I have charged it multiple times thinking maybe it was lacking because it didn’t charge all the way. That wasn’t the issue. The curser is lagging and I am unable to use the center piece to scroll through pages. I couldn’t figure out how to message the seller to see what their next steps would be.,72,1.0,2021,11,November,01
Great but wheel stopped working after just 5 months,9,The mouse is a cool design with it lighting up as you move the mouse around.  My only grip with it is the mouse scroll wheel is not functional.  I've only had it for 2 1/2 months and the scroll wheel stop working. I thought that with charging the unit it would fix the problem but to no eval.  Unfortunately I would not purchase this again.,66,3.0,2021,11,November,01

Good,1,My favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch. The colors are a great addition and add to the experience of using it. It feels sleek as you move it on a mousepad and all other surfaces and textures. The customer service has been splendid. They replaced a mouse for me and helped answer questions when I inquired about getting a replacement usb receiver. They were a pleasure to communicate with. No complaints,78,5.0,2021,11,November,01

great value for the price,5,"Works, and the battery lasts a week or two with frequent use and charges easily. One less cord to get snarled in my laptop case, too.The lights around the edge seem silly, but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark.Goes to sleep after a few minutes of nonuse, requires a mouse click to wake it up, a nuisance, but that means you need not bother to turn it off.Overall, very pleased.",76,5.0,2021,10,October,29
Stopped working after a day,5,"Its a good mouse. Slim, quiet and the battery lasts forever on one charge. Its not very durable though so don't drop it. Luckily its snaps back in place if you do.",32,1.0,2021,10,October,29

Good for the price,4,The scrolling mechanism stopped working within 20 minutes of use. I didn’t drop it or handle it improperly. It’s just a piece of junk.,24,4.0,2021,10,October,27
Excellent,1,"The product is cheap and worked well for the first 2 months, but after that it started becoming unresponsive. I would plug it in because I thought it was low in power, but that didn't solve the issue either. I use a lap top and have a lap desk where it has a built in mouse pad area. I've had it for years so I was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn't able to read it. So I bought a new 3M mouse pad, but still nothing. Tried updating drivers with various programs, tweaked a bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites. Nothing. So I disconnected it and brought out my WIRED  mouse and it isn't working either! This product even disabled my track pad, but luckily I found a way to get it working. I blame this crap product, as it literally almost bricked my laptop",156,4.0,2021,10,October,27

Very Stiff NOT east to use.,6,"After two months of non-regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly.  Scroll wheel has completely stopped working on it's own and now feels somewhat ""loose"" when touched.

Unreliable,1,"I really like this mouse. I love that it doesn't need batteries! You just charge it and it's ready to go. I did have a issue with my MacBook Pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer, it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad, and I wasn't able to scroll without using the mouse. I had to call Apple to figure out how to fix it and that's when I discovered removing the usb-c adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem. I have a usb-c to USB adapter from the Mac store, so I just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly, and it doesn't change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all.",129,2.0,2021,10,October,27

The Type C port for MacBook doesn’t work as it should,11,"Constantly ""times out"" or goes to sleep, and every time I try to move it to use it again, it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds - at first, not a big deal, but do that for a few weeks, and it's incredibly frustrating. I went back to my old mouse. I'll know next time to pay for a better mouse.",67,1.0,2021,10,October,27

"Fun, cute, laces.",3,"I was wary of buying a no-name brand mouse, but it turned out to be even better than I expected. It’s super sleek and looks great with the LEDs. It also functions VERY well - the clicks are almost silent (if you’ve used a cheap mouse that has LOUD clicks you’ll know what I’m talking about, haha) and it’s very reactive. I use it for light gaming and it’s perfect. I haven’t even had to charge it yet, which is amazing. Absolutely worth it for the price!!",87,4.0,2021,10,October,26

Cute but chord was mangled,5,"As I've just learned by searching questions, after using it for a few weeks, the scroll wheel stops working. Also, these are silly lights for a grownup.

Meh,1, I bought one of these from this company and it stopped working within the first 2 weeks.I messaged the seller upset because I could not return. I thought maybe buying the “upgraded” version would be best option before making a large complaint because it was a nice mouse for the little time I was able to use it.Big mistake.The second one stopped working within 2 weeks of using it continuously.I can’t return if either to receive my money back or receive a replacement.It’s frustrating because of the fact that I work from home and need a mouse.I am going to make a complaint through Amazon itself. But i wanted to warn others not to waist your money.Good luck!,118,3.0,2021,10,October,24

I've tried different mouse pads, and it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it.

Works Good,2,"I have now purchased 2 of these computer mice, both of which have broken and become unusable within just a few weeks. With the first one, I thought I got a defective item, so I returned it and got the same model again for exchange. Now that one has broken too, conveniently just 2 days outside the return window.  In both instances, the click wheel stopped functioning, making scrolling impossible. These were handled with care in my home office, and not used improperly, or dropped, or exposed to moisture, etc. They just seem very cheaply made. The LED lights were a nice feature but meaningless without a functioning mouse. As far as the ergonomics, I often found my hand hurting. The mouse is so low-profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver. I do not recommend this product.",139,5.0,2021,10,October,22

Very Solid Mouse,3,"Initially, I was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse. It is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse, and it worked well.

Ergonomic mouse,2,Had this mouse less than a week. My kids knocked it off my desk. The mouse broke in half and will not snap back together. Has no durability! Save your money and buy a more reputable brand. My prior mouse was dropped dozens of times with no issues. Will be ordering one from that brand. This one is not worth the money.,62,5.0,2021,10,October,21
Quiet,1,Worked flawlessly for a few days then the left button became  unreliable. Not worth the hassle to return.Update: Seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered a refund if I took down this review. I replied I'd rather have a corrected unit which I would then review. They replied they weren't fixed yet and offered to 2x my refund. I ignored it.,66,4.0,2021,10,October,21
Right click stopped working 5 months after i bought it,10,"I bought this yesterday to replace a broken mouse. Day 1, has incredibly noticeable lag. I fully charged it before using it. It runs about the same as a turtle stuck in syrup. This isn't worth $15, just buy a different mouse.Update: The brand behind this sent me an email from a shady address claiming to be ""Amazon Custom Service"" and offered me $20 to delete the review. Not a chance. I urge you to stay away from this brand, they're shady af. They'll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product.",94,1.0,2021,10,October,21

Good basic RGB wireless mouse,5,"Ergonomics are great. Quality is okay, very lite weight and made of cheap plastic.

Versatile little mouse.,3,It is not response at all. It is very jerky and doesn’t react for several seconds. I have used several cordless mice before but this gets the thumbs down.,29,3.0,2021,10,October,20
Works as expected,3,"Update 02.24.2022: I'm not sure why, but this mouse is working better than it did when I originally purchased it back in October 2021.  I use it EVERY DAY and I don't mind charging it over night every couple of days or so.  It IS comfortable to use, and kind of funky (in a good way) to use the changing lights feature from time to time.  Naturally, this will make the battery run down faster, but once in a while I enjoy the light show...  LOL and I love how the ""click"" is SO QUIET!They say they've upgraded this product so I hope you'll give it a try too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review October 2021:  My use of this mouse consists of following:6 hours of use (without the pretty little alternating lights on) and then it's switched off for the night.Before my next 6 hours are over, this thing runs out of life and must be charged again.I'm not at all thrilled with it.It does have a nice quiet click, but if I have to charge it every time I use it, I don't think it will last very long....",187,5.0,2021,10,October,20

It’s a mouse,3,The cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly. One must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse I have ever had. Seek elsewhere - go to a local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to.,48,5.0,2021,10,October,18
Mouse Dead,2,"People always ask me about my mouse when I use it at school. Love the colors, love that its rechargeable.

My kids love them ❤,5,"I am very disappointed in this mouse. while using it, the mouse will constantly stop working and I will have to turn it off and on just to get it to work again.

Ugh,1,"Love this mouse. Purchased the mint green for laptop. Works great so far. Dongle was tight to remove but that's ok.

I wanted to like this mouse but it kept failing,10,I do you like it so far but it started to come apart at the seam !!  I put it together a bit concerned If it's going to just do this again Must be due to quality I have been very careful with it,44,2.0,2021,10,October,18
Don't buy it or you will be losing your money,10,"The mouse checks all my needs: wireless,  low profile, and inexpensive.I used to have a roller ball mouse but found myself having to frequently clean the ball from lint and dirt so this is a vast improvement.I've used this for a few days now and haven't had to charge it yet so so far so solid.",56,1.0,2021,10,October,18

Amazing product,2,"I purchased this in July and it worked perfectly. It's now ""ass backwards"" You have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor. If I let go of the button  IT DOES NOTHING. Its completely off track. The LED only works when it's charging. Before it worked whenever it was on the last switch  on the bottom of the mouse.",64,5.0,2021,10,October,18
Awful,1,I followed the instructions to the letter and it was slow and laggy.,13,1.0,2021,10,October,18
Died literally 20 days after it was out of warranty!,10,"I bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile. I wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag. This fits the bill.This mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites, using office applications like word, excel and powerpoint etcI would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes, and that is not what it is meant for anyway.If you want a mouse that works for web browsing/office work on the go, looks nice and is slim and compact get this device!",91,1.0,2021,10,October,16

Dislike,1,"This is a very nice mouse for the price. The charge in the battery lasts a long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever. Perfect for use during a lecture at school when you don’t want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises. I’m not sure how this would be for gamers, but the switchable DPI is a very nice feature, as well.Also, I do feel that I should point out that the RGB lights are switchable on and off, which is a nice feature if you are like me and are in a class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips.",109,1.0,2021,10,October,15
Reliability,1,I bought this mouse back in July to use with my laptop when I was in class. This would equate to a few hours each week. The mouse stopped working after about a month and I charged it overnight. The blue light never turned off and now the mouse will not turn on or work at all. Such a bummer because I really liked everything about it.,67,5.0,2021,10,October,15

Impressive,1,"When I first received the mouse it worked well and I enjoyed the multi-colors.  However, after 1 month it constantly needed to be charged.  By three months it no longer cycled the different colors, but was only red.  Now at the 7 month mark it no longer tracks, I move the mouse but my cursor doesn't move on the screen.

Works great quick pairing,4,The box was torn and there is a scratch/ smudge on it.  I hope it works well.The colors are beautiful though.  I love how the white mouse looks.  It's very clean.  4 stars because of the smudge I can't get off and packaging.  It's obvious I'm not the first one to own it.,53,5.0,2021,10,October,13

Kinda cheap,2,"Got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn't work. Light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn't work. Figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work. Mouse was doing great until I found a issue with its sleep mode. When the mouse falls asleep to save battery, it wakes up very quickly. However from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed. It's ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse. I turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem. So the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible. Have to turn it on and off as needed.",125,3.0,2021,10,October,11
Great item,2,"I bought these for my classroom, I have Sixteen total. They are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode.

Does the job,3,"It needs to be charged daily, as I use it all day at work. I do like the color changing light, it brightens up my day!",26,5.0,2021,10,October,11

Will buy again without hesitation.",57,2.0,2021,10,October,11
Perfect!,1,I got this for my daughter for school. It is perfect and appeals to her teenage likes,17,5.0,2021,10,October,11
Works very well,3,Worst wireless mouse I have ever purchased.  The lag time to respond to movement is horrble.  Clicking is even worse.  Sometimes I have to click three or four times before the mouse works.  I tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop.  Do not purchase.  A complete waste of money and time.,60,5.0,2021,10,October,11
Good cheap mouse,3,I really wanted to like this mouse as it’s lightweight and cute but it’s not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it’s not compatible with my MacBook I can’t use it while charging since I have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging. Also lights stopped changing colors and you can’t set to one color.,62,3.0,2021,10,October,11
not worth the money keep scrolling broke,7,"I loved this mouse. It was slick and easy to use. However it was not once I used on a regular basis. I only used it may 1 hour max each day.

Silent and super light,4,"Nice low silhouette and quiet action. Does what is expected of a mouse and is good looking to boot. Obviously cannot judge it’s ergonomic qualities from such a short term of usage, but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers. Holds a charge well. The only caveat I might mention is that the dongle is a bit too short for if you’re using while charging, but that is a minor issue. Well pleased with this mouse.",82,5.0,2021,10,October,09
Cost effective,2,"Works great, rechargeable, and pretty for my girls 😊",9,5.0,2021,10,October,09
All around great mouse,4,Regularly stops tracking movement into a disjoint and jerky cursor movement. Seems to depend on the color of the surface underneath (based on my multicolor mousepad).OEM harassed me with emails about changing my review. Amazon leaked my email that was only given to Amazon.,44,5.0,2021,10,October,08
Works,1,I work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when I bought it. Now it has decided that it doesn’t want to charge and is currently useless after only 5 week. I was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working. It sucks because it’s such a fun mouse. It also never leaves my home office so I know it’s not from packing or moving it around a lot,88,5.0,2021,10,October,08
"Great Mouse, Questionable Service",4,"The mouse is ergonomically comfortable and I like the cool lights. However, difficult to enjoy these features when the mouse doesn’t work.

Jerky and barely works,4,This mouse is wonderful and easy to use without a mouse pad which is a big plus. Bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does't stick out the side of my laptop to far.

only lasted maybe 40 uses,5,I like this wireless mouse for now. Hoping nothing goes wrong with it. So far it's been very dependable and works correctly. The design is perfect and I love the different colors. It works the moment you connect the USB connector to the computer and turn the mouse on.

Broke in less than 2 months,6,Just what I needed and I like the colors. Real sleek in hand,13,1.0,2021,10,October,04
Nice and small in these 'old' hands,7,"***Update 12/10/21*** This mouse is garbage. I wrote my review after one day of good functionality, but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently, buttons don't always work when I click something. If I take out the USB and turn on/off the mouse it fixes it for a few minutes until it goes into sleep mode. The first one they sent me didn't work at all and this new one just doesn't work. It works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff. Ordering something else.The mouse works great for my Dell laptop. Fits comfortably, sleek profile, no problems. The button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse. I had an issue with my first shipment, but customer service was very responsive, problem-solved with me, and then shipped me a new mouse very quickly.",152,5.0,2021,10,October,04
Charging cable is WAY TOO SHORT,6,"But the item Jul 2021, 6 months i didnt chrage it more than 4 times yet the charger broke. Its nice but wont last",24,1.0,2021,09,September,01
Very Good For Daily Computer Activities,6,"This mouse is good for its price. Its light, and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice. When you press down it's more of a subtle, soft click which I like a lot, rather than an annoying and loud click. However, it does feel a little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low. When using the LED mode you can practically see inside the mouse. Once again though, for $15, it's not bad! I like it because I can connect it to my Macbook air too, which uses an USB-C.",96,5.0,2021,10,October,04
No longevity,2,"I love the sleek design of this mouse.  My favorite aspect, though, is the quiet clicking - the noise is muted and that is an unexpected bonus!",27,1.0,2021,10,October,04

Not Macbook Compatible,3," In all honesty, there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for a mouse, but you know what?  In this time of the pandemic, we can all use a bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy -- especially visually.  This little mouse (I got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time) always brings a smile.  Btw, it IS quiet -- no noisy clicks, the color is beautiful and classic, and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers. If you're still on the fence -- get one (or more) if you want to give yourself a little (and very useful) treat.",118,1.0,2021,10,October,02
It's ok...,2,I've had this about a month and it's struggling to hold a charge and the mouse is jumping. There is also no option to return!! I'll be going back to a regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable. Dissapointed!,42,3.0,2021,10,October,02
Short battery life.,3,"I work from home and in the office.  I have to transport my laptop and mouse.  I have forgotten my mouse more time that I can remember at the office.  I bought 2 of these so I can keep 1 at home and 1 at the office.  They only hold a charge for less than a week.  It might have to do with it having lights on it, but my other mouse holds a charge of heavy usage for a month.  Will not buy again as I need something to hold a charge much longer.",95,3.0,2021,10,October,02
awful,1,Exactly what I was looking for. Sleek and quiet and also pretty with the lights! You can turn the rainbow lights off if you don’t want them on.,28,1.0,2021,10,October,02
No good,2,"I was used to buying name brand 'mouses'.  And I was worried about the size of this device. But actually its a good size just with a lower profile.  Works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top.  The lighting is nice, not real bright but just a strip around the outside and the button lights up.  Changes color which is a nice touch.  So I actually like it better than the other larger mouses I have.",83,1.0,2021,10,October,01
Was nice when it worked,5,"You get what you pay for. If you just need a quick mouse on the go so you don’t need a touch pad, this is great. Enduring use of everyday mouse, spend the money for one that is lightweight, ventilated, ergonomic, or a combination. This one, soft clicks, decent feedback, good battery. Just not super high quality for the desk job",61,2.0,2021,10,October,01

AWFUL PRODUCT - DEPENDED ON AMAZON FOR GOOD PRODUCTS,9,"I needed a couple of these for my kids for their laptops. I knew they would like the vibrant colors the mouse shows while you are using it and that I would love the rechargeable and quiet functionality. The mouse definitely has exceeded my expectations of it and I couldn't be more pleased at this product. The ergonomic fit and soft, quiet buttons make the experience using this mouse very easy going. I've burned through many a mouse myself, some very expensive name brand ones that should've done their job and then some but I've always found a defect in them down the road. So far so good with these and I could see the durability of this product especially given my twin 7 year olds will use them to their fullest. Great customer service to top it off and I highly recommend this mouse for anyone in need of one or is looking for the right one.",158,1.0,2021,09,September,30

Quit working after 3 weeks of use,7,Works good very comfortable when using it for work and gaming battery life is about 33hrs I say that because it almost lasted a full work week.,27,1.0,2021,09,September,30
Don’t buy it!,3,"I love the mouse. It's a great fit for me, it has options for both hands, is quiet, and the color (I ordered mint green) is exactly what was shown/ what I wanted. The LED lights run briefly when that option is selected, but then seem to shut off (I thought they would run continuously). Maybe if I use it for longer periods it could have an effect. I'll see what happens.The biggest issue is that the USB-C adapter does not fit in my computer or my phone. The little pamphlet that comes with the mouse says to contact their customer service email first with any questions/problems. I emailed them the day I got the mouse (four days ago) but so far have no response.",125,1.0,2021,09,September,30

I enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel.",68,5.0,2021,09,September,29
Unreliable mouse,2,Bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it's not a perfect match it's still very pretty and I love the lights! It is a very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse.Update:So I received this mouse exactly 10 days ago and the scroll button is broke. I went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver (Very small btw) it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in. so not only did my brand new less than 2 week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making a fort nox screw. not happy save your money.,118,2.0,2021,09,September,29
Mouse,1,"It does everything I ordered it to do for a good price. rechargeability is a huge plus to me for a wireless mouse, the clicks are satisfying, and it feels nice to hold.

Great,1,I have two problems. No matter how long you charge it for it’s dead in an hour. That’s if it been works.  The usb plug in takes two people to get out and I’m afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer.  The appearance is great but it doesn’t work and could break the USB port. Because of this I do not recommend.Since this posted the company offered 40$ To change review instead of just sending another mouse.

I have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing.Update: Now I'm being offered money to remove my comment. $40-45. No I will not.

Poor quality,2,The design is pretty but the functionality is crappy. My mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with.

Didn't work,2,"For the money, this mouse is a great value! I needed a new mouse, as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to ""miss"".  I wanted something fairly inexpensive, wireless and rechargeable. I am tired of having to switch out batteries. This mouse fit all those perfectly.  My first month impression is .. it's excellent.  After the initial charge, it's still going strong with maybe an hour a day usage, after 3 weeks.  It goes to ""sleep"" after a period of inactivity, which helps to conserve the battery.  My only gripe, would be the slim profile.  I think I prefer a little more bulk in my palm.  My only contact with the mouse when navigating, is with my fingers, no palm contact.  This does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as a slim profile design.  All in.. I am glad I purchased this mouse.

Not working !!!!!,3,"Finally, a sleep mode that is done right! ALL my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake, pretty standard. Well, when I wake those other mice with a right or left click it is a active click. Which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens a menu or activates what I clicked. Always frustrated me LOL!Well this one is super nice, you click and it's awake without doing an activation or selection. I have been looking for this in a wireless mouse and have finally found it!Also, it has a nice feel, not super ergonomic, but nice. The color selection is nice, I chose the grey. The RGB lights are very pleasant to the eyes. I haven't had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but I will update soon. The cable that comes with the mouse is very short, but that isn't a problem. The DBI variety is nice as well. Very happy with this mouse!",174,1.0,2021,09,September,20
No complaints,2,I have used this for 18 days (realistically less bc it’s only used M-F). It won’t hold a charge now and dies before lunch despite being plugged up over night.,30,5.0,2021,09,September,20

died after a month,4,I bought this mouse for home use.  I used it about two hours per day for two weeks.  Then no connection.. I thought it needed to be charged.  plugged it in and allowed to sit for two hours as instructed.  Now there is NOTHING.  Tried to charge longer but nothing is working!

Good performance,2,"Mouse is comfortable to use. Silent clicks. However, failed after only 2 months of use. I use every day for maybe a couple of hours at a time. Turned off when not in use and plugged in when necessary. Died about a week ago after having for only 2 months. Would not recharge. Will not use a  rechargeable mouse again. Would rather use rechargeable batteries.",65,5.0,2021,09,September,18

Gets job done,3,I needed a new mouse because the one I had been using was so old and was unreliable. This new one is so nice for such a great price! It fits my hand comfortably and has super quiet clicks which is super nice. It charges instead of using batteries which is a feature that I LOVE!! So excited to keep using this product!,63,5.0,2021,09,September,18
Great Product,2,The charger was a real pain. My kids stopped using it the 2nd week,14,5.0,2021,09,September,18
Love this mouse,3,I use this all day during work and then I use it to play the sims I the evening or on the weekend. It charges quickly and the battery lasts so long. I love that the mouse automatically goes into sleep mode because I often forget to turn it off. The matte finish is sleek and comfortable. I have no complaints,61,5.0,2021,09,September,18
USB broke in laptop,4,I work from home and this is a great mouse overall! It’s super slim and it lights up but it’s not super bright that it’s bothering you.,27,1.0,2021,09,September,17

Love it.,2,Doesn’t work and won’t charge. Cheap.,6,5.0,2021,09,September,17
Good quality,2,I am really happy with the purchase of this mouse. I had been looking for a good mouse that cheap and wireless. This is the best fit. I am able to carry this everywhere and has long lasting battery. Also the range of the Bluetooth is really good because I was able to control my computer while I was another room,61,5.0,2021,09,September,17
A nice mouse for the price,6,"This mouse is quiet as advertised, so it's nice as someone sleeps in my office while I do schoolwork most of the time. The sleep mode on it is nice, but I feel it triggers too soon. That being said, it's bothersome, but not a deal breaker. I was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made (I'm sure it is), but it's traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident, knock on wood. I'm sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it, it could very well break or crack, but if you treat it well, I don't see why this mouse shouldn't last you. I've had it for about a month now and the only thing I can complain about is the sleep timer, so take that as you will.",142,5.0,2021,09,September,17
USB plug for computer fell apart,6,I got this mouse for work. It works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can’t be used with battery it’s only usb charger so the only down side of this if u work with it for 4-5 days u will need to charge it or it will die on u and u have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it! It’s unfortunately not for me and I don’t like how it doesn’t have battery or dies fast!,85,1.0,2021,09,September,16
You get what you pay for.,6,"With the price, I was skeptical, but this mouse really does work well. As soon as I plugged in the USB, it took all of 15 second before I could start using it. The clicks are smooth and quiet, and it feels great ergonomically. The lights also look really good. I highly recommend it.",54,2.0,2021,09,September,16
Stopped working after 4 months.,5,"It won’t charge at all, two weeks after I bought it and it’s already useless. The blue light turns off like it’s charged but it’s totally dead. Tried different cables and it just doesn’t work",35,3.0,2021,09,September,16
Works great,2,Only have had this mouse for 2 months and already have to replace it. The charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging. The port is wobbling around not making contact to charge. Going back to battery operated wireless mouse.,46,5.0,2021,09,September,16
Stopped working after 1 month,5,"I waited a while to leave a review. I tought it would last, but it didn't. It was really smooth and long lasting battery. Little did i know while using it it would become apart internally. The scrollwheel broke. I usually fix my electronics easily, sometimes things just need a little adjustment but, this part broke and with no fixing. Maybe some of you are lucky and doesn't break easily. Mine did and not even 3 weeks of using it.",80,1.0,2021,09,September,14
Very good,2,"After a month and a half of buying this wireless mouse, the piece where you charge it, is broken. I have been extremely careful with it, and never dropped it. Loved it, but poor quality. Don’t buy it.",38,5.0,2021,09,September,14

Stopped working after one month,5,I purchased this mouse to use with a chrome book. It pairs well and I have no complaints.

I would totally try more of their products.,53,1.0,2021,09,September,14
Doesn't work,2,"Adorable little mouse...however...the darn thing will be on and won't do anything. I know to click to wake it (if it's in sleep mode) but half the time it won't be asleep and I have to click like 5 times for it to start actually working. Unfortunately, I'll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience.",60,1.0,2021,09,September,14
"junk, broke after 2 weeks and sensitivity is supper high for its lowest mode",14,"The mouse look and feel is nice and sleek but it does not slide well due to the bottom strips coming off and restricting the movement.

"Rechargeable, no battery needed",4,"The ergonomics are good, but it has a fatal flaw that makes it unusable.  When you first turn it on, it works fine.  But after 5 minutes or so, it becomes very ""twitchy"" or""jerky"" and completely unusable.I tried it on both Macs and PCs.  Same problem with both systems.It's too cheap to bother sending back, but I want to warn others not to make the same mistake.",67,5.0,2021,09,September,13

Liked it but now I am upset,7,I didn't know it was possible to like a mouse so much! It is very comfortable and smooth. The battery life is pretty long. I don't like having to charge it because sometimes I forget to plug it in and then it goes dead. The battery life usually last around a week. As long as I can remember to charge it it is fantastic.,64,3.0,2021,09,September,12
Cute but crap.,3,I used this mouse once and it died after an hour .. was on the charger literally over night .. now i can’t even get it to charge at all .. waste of my money!,35,1.0,2021,09,September,12

Poor Dongle Placement,3,"I ordered this mouse.  I really liked it - It was slim, fit nicely in my hand and I loved how the lights changed colors.  After a few months, there was a problem with it.  When the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked.  Great customer service.  I would order it again after dealing with them if I hadn't already bought another mouse because I had work to finish.  I give them 5 stars",81,2.0,2021,09,September,12
Going strong... prettttttty,3,Straight out of the package I had issues but figured I would hold on. The mouse does not move smoothly. Cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly. Then it would stop and I would have to jerk it around.. and now it has just stopped. Just upgrade ... spend a little more on a logi mouse and it is worth it.,66,5.0,2021,09,September,12
Nice design,2,"I got sick of using my touchpad and needed an actual mouse for 3D printing software. Trying to rotate and re-size print patterns with a touchpad was a nightmare, but this is a great mouse for the price and has already made my life a lot easier!",47,5.0,2021,09,September,12

FUNCTIONAL & FREAKING CUTE!,4,It was made of cheaper plastic then I expected and refused to charge after it ran out after the first time.  Wasn't enough money to make it worth my time trying to return it.  The color change was cool was it lasted.,42,5.0,2021,09,September,11
Disappointed,1,I love my mouse it's so cute and works great.,10,1.0,2021,09,September,11
Perfect,1,"I didn't like the way the light shown thru the top, like the plastic was super thin and semi-transparent and it didn't come thru evenly. I have been using it for a while now and it sometimes gives me trouble. I have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes. Just unplug USB and plug back in fixes it. Still 5 stars because at this price it's great!",77,5.0,2021,09,September,10
Doesn’t hold charge,3," Works well until it goes into sleep mode.  When you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around.  The only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on. Which seems minuscule, but it gets really annoy the longer you use it.Maybe I just got a defective one? It's got some really high marks... but buyer beware.Video shows it being woken up, then I turn it off/on and it works fine.",80,1.0,2021,09,September,10

Very quiet mouse,3,"Literally, only had the mouse for three days and used it on the first day and now it has stopped working !

This mouse is literally a piece of crap. Will be getting my money back !!!",72,5.0,2021,09,September,10
Would Not Recommend,3,"Very nice for the price. I usually use it for about 5 hours at a time and the battery holds. I have put about 80 hours on it and it's still working fine. It is simple, light, relatively comfortable, and it looks sharp.",43,1.0,2021,09,September,09

Loved it for a couple of weeks,7,"I LOVE this mouse!! It fit & feels great in my hand- I’m on the computer a lot, so that is important to me. I LOVE the colors!!

Not very durable,3,"The mouse didn't track well and kept freezing, and then my laptop shut down within 10 seconds of plugging the adapter in. I would avoid this one.",27,3.0,2021,09,September,08
Lasted Less than 2 Months,5,Needed a wireless mouse for a work laptop and this mouse gets the job done. The price is very affordable and the product came very fast. Was pleasantly surprised by how quiet the clicking sound- that should come in handy during the early mornings work days. Would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their Macbook (USB C port).,63,1.0,2021,09,September,08
Happy with the product,4,Long battery life. The lights are beautiful and you can change them. The mouse is sleek and gets the job done.,21,5.0,2021,09,September,08

Light leaks through the case back,6,The USB port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for 2 days. There was nothing that happened that would have/should have caused the usb to break other than it being poorly made. I’m am very disappointed with the outcome.,44,2.0,2021,09,September,08

It arrived used and did not work,7,Good quality mouse. Very easy to pair and it feels nice in your hand. I like the Led touch,19,1.0,2021,09,September,07
Glitchy,1,"I wanted to find a slim, wireless mouse similar to a Mac's magic mouse, without the high price tag. While this certainly *isn't* a magic mouse, it's a pretty good substitute for a fraction of the cost. There are some tradeoffs of course, due to the slim nature of this mouse - it is extremely lightweight (i.e. not built like a tank) and sometimes the buttons require a sturdy click to ensure a response. But, all in all, I'm happy with my purchase. It looks nice, works well and it has gone about 2 months so far without needing a recharge. Speaking of which...I leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode. No big deal, just realize you need to click a button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop. Otherwise, it will seem like the mouse isn't working. Also, I've had a couple of instances where I had to reinsert the USB adapter to get it to reconnect. But, that was maybe 2 times in the past couple of months.In short, I recommend this product. The company provided great support when I received the wrong color mouse and they've been top-notch to deal with. They stand behind their product.",210,2.0,2021,09,September,07
"I found this very hard to use. Doesn’t work easily,",10,This product already fell apart! It’s very lightly used and the mouse is broken already!,15,1.0,2021,09,September,06
Not worthy.,2,Right out the box I noticed the very plastic/cheap feel. The RBG lights are bright but I honestly bought it for a cheap mouse. After using it for a while the wrist did start hurting a little. The worse part is after it died for the first time I did a full charge and it has not worked since. I'm sure I can go through the warranty but I'll just take the loss. You get what you paid for.,79,1.0,2021,09,September,06
Works horribly,2,"I really enjoyed this mouse at 1st due to my job, but less than 4 months of using it it has completely stopped working.

Nice shape but battery seem to go low quite fast,10,"It was important for me to have a mouse that not only I could see in the dark, but something that was quiet.

Broken in 2 months!,4,"This is a realy bad mouse, iv used it for about 2 weeks now and the sensor only picks up half of my movements, the rgb is basally non existent and the feel of this mouse is realy crapy.

AMAZING mouse!! No issues and everything I was looking for,10,"This is by far my favorite mouse! I can wake up my computer by tapping the button on the mouse.

No batteries to buy!",61,5.0,2021,09,September,03
It's garbage - won't hold a charge,7,I like that the mouse is slim. I also like the lights and how smooth it is. The sleep mode works fine. I use the mouse for work. I am happy with the rechargeable functionality and I find I don’t need to recharge daily. So far I have recharged every few days and I don’t know how long the change will last but at least 4 days for daily work use. It is a good value in my opinion.,79,1.0,2021,09,September,03

I had to use tools to get it out and now it’s no longer usable.  Very upset, I have a lot of work I have to get done and using a mouse makes it smoother to navigate.

Nope,1,"This mouse is so hard to use that I’m scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys. Push the left button 10 times, it might place the cursor, select the word or do nothing, depends on the mouse gods. If you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you FINALLY get it where you want and if you type, nothing happens.This thing is trash. Buying a Logitech mouse to replace.",71,2.0,2021,09,September,02
Waste of money,3,The mouse is fine but the scroll button started squeaking almost immediately and is pretty annoying.,16,2.0,2021,09,September,02
Stopped working after 20mins,4,Mouse was just OK. The USB C adapter didn’t work at all. Junk parts.,14,1.0,2021,09,September,02
For my Linux mint it works amazing!,7,The mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy. I remove it from my laptop when it's not in use and put it back under the mouse. Its pretty difficult to remove it again without some kind of sharp edge. I feel like it will eventually break.,52,5.0,2021,09,September,02

Doesn’t last,2,"This mouse was disappointing. It would work for a while and then it would lose connection and stop working. I thought at first it was losing traction and wasn’t sensing movement. So, I bought an entirely new mousepad. Did the same thing. After a few minutes of use, it would lose connection.",52,5.0,2021,09,September,02
Looks Good but that is it. Does not work,9,Works well as described. Slim and easy to use. Even came with dongle for USB-C if your computer has it. lights can be turned on and off.,27,1.0,2021,09,September,02

Only worked a few days,5,"I bought mine in Mint Green! It's almost effortlessly easy to set up. The battery is lasting beautifully.  I absoulutely love it soooo much, I just ordered my daughter one, in the dark gray. She's going to love the LED lights. THANK YOU!!!",43,1.0,2021,09,September,02
Loved it…until,2,I was looked forward to having this mouse but I used about twice since I got and it's not working already. I don't know if it's defective or what. I guess there go my $13...,35,4.0,2021,09,September,02
defective and flimsy product,4,Set up couldn't be easier.  I put the white USB thing into my computer and the mouse magically worked.  That's all it took!  I got the gold rose and it's very pretty.,32,2.0,2021,09,September,02
Good price for what you get,6,Would love it if it held a charge or had a backup space for a battery. I have to constantly charge this usually every two days in the middle of my work day. Im over it going to go back to a battery mouse.,44,5.0,2021,09,September,01
A must buy! You won't be disappointed!,7,"The mouse drags, after I use for like an hour, battery does not last too long, it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use. Will not buy.

stopped working after one week!,5,Mouse goes dormant after 20-30 seconds and is Extremely glitchy until you turn it off and back on and then it works OK until you stop using it again. Zero out of five would never buy again,37,1.0,2021,09,September,01
Junk,1,"The USB-C receiver was missing upon opening, which was the main reason I got this mouse! I tried using it with another laptop and after fully charging it, it would not work!! After charging for hours and hours again, it still would not work! Very disappointed.",46,1.0,2021,09,September,01

Worth the purchase,3,It broke after 4 weeks.,5,5.0,2021,08,August,31
Good,1,Wish I hadn't missed the return window on this one. This mouse does not have a range of 10 meters as stated. It has difficulty tracking at just 1 meter (or even a couple of feet) away. This was supposed to replace a mouse from another seller that I also had trouble with. It turned out to be the same exact mouse. It's disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products. I would recommend spending a little more money on a mouse from a reputable brand.,91,5.0,2021,08,August,31

Nice mouse,2,"Loved the look and feel of this mouse, but after only 4 weeks of school, the USB completely came apart when I pulled it out of my son's Chromebook.

Good so far,3,It quit working after less than 2 months. Ugh!  It’s no wonder they only have a 30 day return policy.,20,4.0,2021,08,August,30
Good spare,2,"I have been using the wireless mouse for 3 weeks.  I waited to write the review so I could truly review it based on my experience. It has not disappointed me, and I like everything about it.  I charge it whenever I remember to. The design is sleek, and the changing colors are soothing. When I take my eyes off the screen, I stare at the mouse. The respond to clicks is smooth, and quick. I can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks.",85,5.0,2021,08,August,30
Love her!,2,Not bad. As expected for the price. Clicks a little loud when you click use it.,16,5.0,2021,08,August,30
Sticky,1,Not attractive when lit up — because the light leaks through the white shell. Just not attractive,17,1.0,2021,08,August,30
Don't Stop Moving,3,"I purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when I was using it.It looked exactly like the mouse in the picture, and was easy to charge and use. It also held a charge for a long time which I was really happy about.The reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for 2 months and then it completely stopped working no matter what I did. I certainly wasn't expecting a wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least 6 months out of it before it died.If you're looking for something cute and short-term and don't mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you.",132,1.0,2021,08,August,30
Broke after only a couple weeks,6,This mouse made my life easier honestly!!!!!,7,3.0,2021,08,August,30
broken after the 2nd week,5,"Upon unpackaging the item, everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow.  However, after a coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding a charge.  The light would turn on indicating that it was charging and a couple of minutes later, the light was off.  I told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so I left it on to charge for a couple of hours.  Unfortunately, the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use.  I found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this.  Ergonomic design and lighting is great, but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose - 1 star.",132,1.0,2021,08,August,30
miss leading,2,"Very disappointed in this product.  The item arrived obviously used and it did not work.  Overall, it was a very negative experience.  Would not recommend.",25,1.0,2021,08,August,30
Good product,2,"So it has problems, the biggest one was the move the cursor on it's own. Like it just spazzes out. I could work with it, didn't mind it all that much besides it being a REAL annoyance when gaming. Then it got more frequent and then the roller that scrolls broke and I only had it for a week or two. SO now I got to replace it. Not a great product. Looks nice but made cheap which I suppose is why it is.",84,4.0,2021,08,August,30
Wireless Mouse,2,"I was looking for a replacement mouse, as my old mouse stopped working properly. When I ordered this, I first received a mouse that did not work properly.

Great mouse for it's price,5,"The USB plug broke after one use. I plugged it into my chromebook's USB port and when I went to remove it, the metal stayed in the laptop.

I love this mouse. Works as expected!,7,"Wish the battery lasted longer. I seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me 6 months before I need to recharge.

Low battery,2,"I liked it a lot at first, worked great. But after one week, it's not working properly.

Light is Red or Cycles through Colors,7,"The battery of this mouse works well. I haven't timed it but I have left it on overnight and it stills has battery. I'm not a gamer but I imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the a PC setup. I recently switched from a laptop that had the standard rectangular port (USB-A) to one that needed the adapter (USB-C). The adapter that comes with the  mouse worked for about a minute before it stop functioning. So I brought out my own adapter (from a different device) and the mouse now works. I also tested both adapters with a wired mouse. It suffices to say that it was the mouse's adapter that is not working. I could have gotten a faulty one, so the problem could be exclusive to me.TL;DR - Mouse adapter didn't work. Ur screwed if urs doesn't work either and don't have an extra one.",160,4.0,2021,08,August,25

My grandmother always said you get what you pay for...and in this instance, she was 100% correct.",71,5.0,2021,08,August,23
FIRE HAZARD 🔥  DANGEROUS. DO NOT BUY,7," I was actually about to return the mouse Bc it stopped working and I couldn’t  find where to replace the batteries.  Had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet (can’t remember if it actually came with instruction booklet).  Went to Amazon and read the product detail and saw that it’s a rechargeable mouse, using a USB cable.Like: it’s small, lightweight, and comfortable.  It fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse, the mouse didn’t feel bulky or heavy.Like: the colors changing - pretty coolLike:  not battery operated.  You can charge using a standard USB cable.Like and Dislike:  I read that there is a silent option to mute click sound - have not found it to test - but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent.  After trying to research how to make the mouse silent, I have still not been able to do so.Like (maybe)  great that there is a sleep mode- not sure where to find it or if I have, really cannot tell the difference.  The options in the back are OFF, ON, and something that looks like a SUN.  When on the “ON”option, I think (I think it’s in sleep mode Bc the light turns red and then turn off) but when on the “SUN”mode, the lights change.Dislike:  When using the mouse, at first, there are no issues.  This is the same experience if the mouse is used with USB cable or wireless.  Randomly, the mouse will then lag and get stuck.  Needed to turn power on and off a few times.Aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off, it’s ok.  I got this mouse as a second mouse Bc the original mouse I purchased was taken by my son.  It is def for the more “casual” user - surfing the internet or checking on EMs.  If trying to use for work, I’d get a mouse a little bit more sturdy and reliable.",333,1.0,2021,08,August,23

Colorful good quality.,3,I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I don't like that anytime I stop using the mouse for a minute or two that the mouse doesn't react. I end up turning it off and on again to get it working. I'm interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it's not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time I stop using it.Edit: Today is day 5 of using the mouse while I wait to receive the other mouse I bought.

But I'm on my computer probably 12-14 hours a day and used my mouse extensively.  A single charge lasts me 4-5 days.  You can also use the mouse when you are charging.  I have a USB port on my keyboard that I use per my attached picture.  As you can see, the charging cable is pretty short.  So some might need to extend the cord.But overall, I am very happy with this mouse.",98,1.0,2021,08,August,22

Works Great!!,2,"Works well, hooked up immediately, love the feels and the look!",11,5.0,2021,08,August,22
Almost caught fire!!!!,3,Batteries would be SO MUCH easier with the way the power runs out after charging by USB. Frustrating because if your in the middle of something I have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use. I love the feel of it though and the cool lights.,52,1.0,2021,08,August,22

I really like this mouse!,5,"The mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun. It auto shuts off after 10 minutes (I think) which is great for saving the battery.

Not good,2,This little mouse works great for my needs. It charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected. I would buy it again and I recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse.,35,1.0,2021,08,August,21
Great Mouse for a Great Price,6,Very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it's a soft touch mouse... no loud clicks here!,18,5.0,2021,08,August,21

Caution: Do NOT purchase this item!! ⚠️,7,"Purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port, no batteries required. It is also compact with a low profile. It will be great for travel because it will take up very little space. Fits easily in a pocket without bulging out.",45,1.0,2021,08,August,20
Stopped working,2,This was a disappointing and irritating order. I am a college student and a full time manager so I work a lot on my laptop. I ordered a mouse for ease of certain tasks that required a right click or highlights. This mouse was unusable directly out of the box. Charged it up and it never held a charge long enough to work. Very disappointing and a waste of time.,70,1.0,2021,08,August,20
It only worked one day,5,"The mouse works fine, but i was disappointed that the color did not match my MacBook as it shows.",19,1.0,2021,08,August,20
Nice Mouse,2,"This mouse has become my new best friend! I have arthritis which has severely affected my hands. Its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage. The mouse is absolutely quiet as promised, plus is easily used without a huge amount of pressure from my fingers, hand, or wrist . The mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations. My hands are grateful, and so am I!Another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark. Also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsOnce charged the battery is good for a quite a few days. I do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily (and sometimes more). I have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for EIGHT days. Actually it was still working but had become a bit slow to react . Rather than wait for it to quit completely I charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week.I am very glad I chose to try this mouse. My next purchase of a mouse (if or when needed) will be a repeat of this one in a different color.This is an unpaid and unsolicited review from a grateful owner.",228,4.0,2021,08,August,20
Love this mouse,3,"it’s a good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can’t turn the red light off when you move it. if you have the rainbow light on, the red light still goes on when you move it so you don’t really get the rainbow effect",48,5.0,2021,08,August,20

It's been a couple months and still works being used every day at work.,60,5.0,2021,08,August,20

DOESNT WORK,2,"Good if you want a wireless mouse that works for 3 months.  Otherwise, buy something else.",16,1.0,2021,08,August,19
Not worth the money!,4,"This wireless mouse is very light and thin. It can be used for a long time after charging.

Great While It Lasted,4,Its a great mouse but it stops tracking if I stop using it.. like the ponter starts lagging.,18,2.0,2021,08,August,19
Good Luck Getting the Dongle Out,6,"The one I ordered will only turn on if the switch is in a strange position that is between the clicks. I had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until I found the very small area where it turns on. Sending it back because its almost impossible to use, if the switch gets moved it takes a few minutes to turn it back on.",66,4.0,2021,08,August,19
Needs to be charged all the time,7,"I used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging. A few times I’ve had (thought I had) issues with the mouse but I had it backwards. That’s my main complaint- too easy to put backwards. It doesn’t attract dust and dirt, works on every surface I’ve put it on…..and it’s cute",52,1.0,2021,08,August,19
TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE,3,"Got this for a great price, the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup.",17,1.0,2021,08,August,19
As advertised. Love you can’t really hear clicks.,8,The mouse arrived with great packaging and easy to do follow instructions. The feel is very smooth.

Would not charge after single use.,6,This mouse is on point. Literally. I had never thought of buying one to this slant and Size until the color locked me in. It's an absolute match to my laptop. The setup was quick and easy. I simply turned it on input the USB and was using within seconds. It's very versatile and works with or without a pad. Lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape.,69,1.0,2021,08,August,19
Don't buy,2,This is a second time I've bought this mouse and its broken on me within a few months. It just decides to work only when it wants to.,28,1.0,2021,08,August,18

So Disappointed,2,Only used it 4 times and went to turn it on and won’t power up. Lasted 32 days. 2 days past the return time they gave of 30 days. What a waste of money. Thanks god it wasn’t much. Don’t waste a dollar on it.,45,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Love it!,2,"I love this mouse! I use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast. I like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven't used it in a while. However, it is easy to wake up as well. I like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors. Its quite and moves smoothly. Did I mention I love it?",64,5.0,2021,08,August,18
Cute but broke very easily,5,Light never turned on. Came dirty,6,3.0,2021,08,August,18
"Easy pairing, and reliable!",4,"I probably should have known... but the light is either red or it cycles through colors. This is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids. I would rather be able to pick a color, but that is not a feature available. Which - is probably something I should have expected - but I was being hopeful.",57,5.0,2021,08,August,18
Not the most durable,4,Really like the feel of the mouse in my hand. Have dropped it numerous times and it keeps working like a charm. So far I am really pleased with it,30,3.0,2021,08,August,18
doesn’t scroll,2,"Bought this LED wireless mouse July 5, 2021 and received it a couple of day later and really loved it!  Well now it's Aug. 24 and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly.  I don't even use it with the fancy light changes on.  I tried charging it a couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should.I noticed that if left still for a few minutes it would sometimes function well, but only for a few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor, if at all.  The little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast.  I am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold a charge....?  Oh, I have also tried using it while connected to the charge port, but it does the same.I would have given it a 5 star rating if it continued working properly as I really like it.  However, since the sudden misfunction, I cannot give it more than 2 stars and I must say that I would NOT recommend this mouse anymore.",182,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Nice mouse,2,"I love this mouse! it is very lightweight with an attractive look. One of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable. Second, you have the option of selecting one color (default to red) or multiple colors (swap automatically).  The switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse. My favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer. Saved me so many times from having a dead mouse. It can also be charged while in use. Overall I would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family.",97,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Sleek and Quiet,3,"Shipping was fast and I loved the LEDs. But today - after a week - it stopped working. I figured it needed a charge. It;s now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off, which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go. But when I disconnect it - nothing, Dead. Guess the low price was a giveaway I should have paid more attention to.",76,5.0,2021,08,August,17

comfort,1,"Within 3 minutes of plugging the new ""rechargeable"" mouse into a USB hub charger (thankfully it wasn't plugged into my daughter's brand new laptop she just opened for her birthday) my house started to smell like smoke and I found the charging cable melting to the mouse in the drawer I'd just put them in to pre-charge. If this had happened at night my house would have probably caught fire. DO NOT BUY. FIRE HAZARD 🔥 DANGEROUS",77,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Sleek item but no LED lights,6,"The wired mouse I've been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises. I love the convenience of this one being wireless, so it's easy to use with my desktop or laptop. It's super easy to install, and while the buttons aren't completely silent, they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse. The colorful LEDs are fun, but it's not a feature I'll be using a lot. So far I've had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all. I certainly recommend this mouse at this price point.",93,2.0,2021,08,August,17
Perfect!!,1,The mouse would be fine except it stopped tracking within 1 month.  Cheaper isn't better,15,5.0,2021,08,August,17
This works great!,3,You can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse. It doesn’t do its main function. The LED is ok … I guess. But what’s the point of a mouse that doesn’t do it’s job!? I guess I have a new flashlight. I’d give 0 stars if I could. Don’t waste your time or money on this!,56,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Does not charge,3,Don't buy this product.  This lasted me about a month and 1 week..just enough time to pass where the window of returning was no longer available. Mouse quit on me while I was taking a final for a test. Perfect timing.,41,1.0,2021,08,August,17
Nice,1,I bought this mouse thinking a rechargeable was the way to do. It worked well for about a day.  I tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all. I've gone back to a battery operated mouse.,42,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Smooth operation!,2,Feels great nice color looks like it will last a very long time. Charge last along time as well.,19,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Mouse does not stay charged more than one day,9,"The left mouse button is impossible to use. I cannot click and drag. It does not respond to a double click. What a nightmare. I would not recommend this at all. I was very excited for a wireless, no battery mouse. I will be returning this.",46,1.0,2021,08,August,17
Doesn’t work,2,This product was definitely worth the money. It's equipped with every function desirable for a wireless mouse. Being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally. The RGB lights were nice as well.,35,1.0,2021,08,August,17
just don’t order,3,It was working great at first but now it's not working. I've had this mouse for about 1 month.,19,1.0,2021,08,August,17

Not happy!!!",57,3.0,2021,08,August,16
Terrible,1,This wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up. The led lights gives it a nice look and the click is silent. The battery last a day I haven’t had to change them. Over all a 10/10 mouse,40,1.0,2021,08,August,16
It's an okay mouse for the price.,7,"I have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with, did not charge. I then tried multiple cables and power sources I already owned, still did not charge. I left it plugged in for 12 hours while I was away from home, I come home to an uncharged mouse. The blue light stays on for about 30 seconds before shutting off. The design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse, I would recommend spending a bit more on a quality mouse that can serve its purpose.",93,3.0,2021,08,August,16

Great purchase !,3,"I just got the item and to be honest I didn’t expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews I thought it was relatively good. The clicking tends to stick w mine and I tried doing a CPS (Clicks per second test) and out of the 20 time I clicked, the test only registered 9. I can say it wasn’t the tests fault since I have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything. For everyday work I won’t say I recommend it but it’s enough for that but for gaming I do not recommend this since 90% of your clicks won’t work because the mouse itself isn’t that great quality.",118,5.0,2021,08,August,16
Receieved Friday used for 2 hours then put away. Non responsive monday.,12,It worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working.

NOPE,1,"If you're looking for a wireless mouse, keep looking! This is not it! The first one I received didn't charge.

Such a shame, because I actually liked it.",61,1.0,2021,08,August,16

DO NOT BUY - does not work at all,9,"As advertised. Love that you can’t really hear the clicks. Charge it once a week and use it approx. 40 to 45 hrs a week, on color changing setting. Easy set up. Would buy again. Only thing I don’t like is the short charging cable which is a personal preference. You would need a usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it’s charging.",71,1.0,2021,08,August,13

I love the led feature, and I used it to play games with friends (Val, league, genshin, etc) and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment.However, today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work :( I turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again, and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it.

Looks Greate!,2,"I have had this mouse for a month and other than I like the colors, it is worthless.  I have tried every kind of surface and mouse pad and the performance is very erratic.

I don't know if it went into ""sleep mode"" or not, but I could not get it to work at all.  Leading me to believe it lost its charge.  Therefore I had to plug it back in to charge.

BUT and this is a strong but, if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly, all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up. I usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it, or my dog, or even me. It could be super light, and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over. It's really annoying.",99,5.0,2021,08,August,07

Amazing,1,"I was searching for a wireless mouse on Amazon and for the price, this was a no-brainer. I received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging, very simple and easy to get it going. The charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about 2 hours, once I plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged. I purchased the Gray to match my laptop, looks good and not as shiny as I thought it would be which is great. Very comfortable with it in my hand and I have pretty big hands, really receptive to the movement when scrolling. The lights feature is cool if you want to have something different. The silent mouse clicking is a great feature as well if you ever have to do work in a quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse. Very satisfied with this purchase so far.",163,5.0,2021,08,August,05

Very comfortable feel to the hand,6,"Out of the box, I couldn't get this mouse to connect with my MacBook (2017 pro). I gave up after 10 min of trying then tried again in a couple days. Now, it does connect but its unusable. The mouse moves 1mm on my screen for a huge amount of movement (and yes, I checked the tracking speed in my settings). Clicking on anything takes about 5 tries and scrolling is impossible. I'm upset by the deceitful overall rating of this mouse. I swear there are bots falsely giving this mouse good ratings.",93,5.0,2021,08,August,03
I love this mouse and glad I bought it!,9,Works as claimed. Lights are pretty. Battery keeps it charged for several days. I do not use it for gaming so I don't know how it would perform.

Excellent for the price,4,"This mouse is terrible. I bought it for work, its not like I needed anything super advanced, just something that would give me a little more space than the touchpad.

Very cute and easy to use. No problems so far!,10,"Ordered this for my 9th grader, she has a laptop provided by her school and she received a laptop from her grandparents as a gift.

Of course its not as solid as the Apple version, so thats why not 5 stars",72,5.0,2021,08,August,02

"Great mouse, but not ergonomic for me",7,"this product is crap, do not buy, opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble. lightweight and cheap feeling, does not slide particularly well, although sleek, it isn't the most ergonomic thing. but worst of all, after plugging in and turning on, the mouse will work normally for around 30 secs, if you leave it idle for longer than that, the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working. tried on multiple devices to no avail. DO NOT BUY, in most cases id say you get what you pay for, but here it feels like even less than that.",102,4.0,2021,08,August,01

Could not maintain bluetooth connectivity out of the box,9,"I don't like the sleep mode if that's what it is that makes me have to press the button every time I want to use it again.

UPDATED REVIEW,2,Did not work at all,5,4.0,2021,07,July,25
A really cute mouse.,4,The mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile. Its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user.  Mine did not come with the type C receiver. I assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling. The most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again. You have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer a lot. There is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up. It seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click a button to start moving again...a slight annoyance.  Not a bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that I am used to using.  The colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick.,177,5.0,2021,07,July,25

Doesn’t work,2,I purchased this for daily use. Although the design and colors were neat ended up breaking. This is not a durable mouse not usb. Another downfall is the light in the mouse could be blinding at times. The mouse dropped once and broke.,43,2.0,2021,07,July,23

Nice,1,"I was super excited for this mouse. Its so sleek and small, it was perfect for me. Unfortunately it doesn't work all that well. Its super glitchy, especially when you turn it on color mode. It lags and sometimes it doesn't even click on what you're trying to click on. Its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer.",62,5.0,2021,07,July,22
No go,2,"I loved the design and cool light features, but true to the old saying... you get what you pay for.  This mouse was pretty bad.  It jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button 2 or 3 times before it responds to your request.  Very frustrating to say the least.  Not a good buy...",62,1.0,2021,07,July,22

Excellent rechargeable mouse,3,"I had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had a lot of reviews. It works great!The mouse looks good and has a sleek design. The LED lights are a fun touch and the DPI feature is nice to have. I had zero issues connecting the mouse to my MacBook wirelessly to with the USB-C port.What I did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use. Coming from a mouse that had an arch in the design, this mouse was a little flatter than that.Another are the clicks and scrolls. It definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling. It's not loud like compared to regular mice, but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse.I did end up returning the mouse, but I would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design. It's still a great mouse overall.",156,4.0,2021,07,July,21

Cool Wireless Mouse,3,Colors are fun. But it doesn’t react great. Charge doesn’t last long if you forget to turn it off over night.  When it’s low on battery it doesn’t work well. Overall it’s an inconvenience.. amending my review to include the following.  If you post a bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down. First by offering a refund. When you tell them not interested they then offered 30 bucks. You can’t pay me to take a review down.  That’s the point of a review. Just make a better product.  You should just refund me.,98,5.0,2021,07,July,17
Had to exchange,3,Battery won’t charge. I guess you get what you pay for. Save the 15$ or whatever this cost is and invest in something better.Wow. Don’t trust these other reviews guys. If you write a bad review aka the truth they will ask you to delete it. If the product doesn’t work obviously people are going to say something. Save your money people and buy from someone else that is better quality.,71,5.0,2021,07,July,17
Waste of money,3,"UPDATE: SELLER HAS SENT MULTIPLE EMAILS ASKING ME TO REMOVE THIS REVIEW IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY, CLAIMING ""This is an email from Amazon costumer service.""This is the 2nd purchase for me.  The first one wasn't labeled ""Upgrade.""  It lasted about 6 months until I dropped it on the floor.  This one, the ""Upgrade,"" doesn't work well at all.  The left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages.  The connectivity was also delayed.

Thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell I'm a customer for life !!!!! Don't hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it.,135,1.0,2021,07,July,15
"Cord severed, but mouse works great!",6,"IUPDATED:  (11-13-21). Returned and bought another as I really liked the way it fit my hand, etc.  The first one didn’t get charged til it was out and then wouldn’t recharge after it died.  I’ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it.  Not going to let it die cuz don’t want to suffer finding out it’s a design flaw.  On the other hand, could have just been the one I first bought. I am so disappointed.  I received my pretty mouse, charged it and love it!  Fits my small hands, no clicking sounds, easy to use.  I received it around July 10.  Today is July 25 and the cursor won't work!!  I hadn't charged it so I plugged it in to charge.  The wheel still works but the clicker won't work.  When I press it, nothing happens.  I would exchange it for a new one but then I don't have many days left to see if it works and really don't want to take a chance on losing my money.  These mice seem to work great for some and don't work for some.  I may figure out which credit card gives a year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent.  At least I could try again.",214,2.0,2021,07,July,15

Against better judgement I agreed to receive a free replacement giving it another chance— so I’ll follow up with a 2nd review!FOLLOW UP: 2nd one worked for 2 weeks and then STOPPED WORKING altogether. The company actually contacted me after submitting my initial review, offering full reimbursement if I’d take it down, followed by instructions on how to do so.

Exactly what I wanted!,4,It half works. I have to charge it a TON and I leave it off if I’m not using it. It also goes to sleep quick and takes *forever* to wake up. I’m not sure if I would order from them again.,42,5.0,2021,07,July,07
Exactly what I needed,4,Mouse only last 2 hours after charging.,7,5.0,2021,07,July,07
It's a nice mouse,4,Cool mouse I like it changes colors while using it LOVE THE FACT I NEVER HAVE TO USE BATTERIES AGAIN FOR A MOUSE.,23,5.0,2021,07,July,07
Charge Time Is Criminal,4,"Love this! Very sleek, very quiet and I actually love the lighting on the sides. I have had no issues. Plug and play!",23,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Not compatible to my Samsung laptop,6,This mouse is good quality for a low price. I love the multi-colored LED lights on the side and middle. I chose the blue and feel like it adds a pop of color to my office! However- the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and I've only used it a little while. Not sure if it came like that or is already wearing. There are probably other products for a similar price that could be better quality.,79,3.0,2021,07,July,06
perfect,1,"Cutest, stylish, clean looked mouse. I have white monitor and white keyboard it goes very well with those. Also it has lights and it’s super comfortable ergonomic. I’m happy with this purchase",32,5.0,2021,07,July,06
NOT  BLUETOOTH,2,"The first day I received the product it worked very well, though I couldn't get seem to get it to charge. It had enough juice to get through the first day so I wasn't too concerned. By the second day, though, something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn't move the cursor (and never moved it as fast as it should). The buttons all seem to work fine still, but without the ability to actually move the mouse as I want to it's pretty useless.",90,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Waste of money,3,"Works great! Color just like into the picture. The best thing is that it’s charge last for a very long time, I don’t have to charge it everyday!",28,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Not the quality I would have hoped,7,The mouse didn't work after the first few hours of use. Troubleshooting didn't work.,14,3.0,2021,07,July,06
Good for the price,4,It's basically junk doesn't hold a charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of a wireless mouse,27,5.0,2021,07,July,06
Don’t waste your money!,4,Works very well but wish it had option for regular battery.,11,1.0,2021,07,July,06

"Great, lightweight, comfortable mouse!",4,I love this mouse. If you have smaller hands or like a mouse that doesn’t feel to big in your hands then this is for you. The color and lights are a cool touch as well.,36,5.0,2021,07,July,06
Good price and excellent functional,5,"Doesn't stay connected. Hard to tell when charged. Has to be charged constantly which negates the convenience of cordless. It looks cute and feels good but obviously cheap plastic. I am returning it to buy a different mouse with better performance that uses a battery so does not need to be hooked up to a usb port and charged constantly.FYI: On 7/27, seller emailed me and wanted me to remove the review. They say they are switching manufacturers. ""Let the buyer beware.""",82,5.0,2021,07,July,05
Not good cheap quality,4,"The mouse worked great; loved it, actually. But the charging cord is severed and while it does charge, it also will shock you a little if you accidentally touch it while plugging into charging port or plugging the mouse in. And because the charging cord is only 6 inches, hard to refrain from touching where it is severed. Will stop using this when a new (different!) mouse arrives.",68,1.0,2021,07,July,05

Sleek design,2,From the day I received all my touchpad headaches are gone. A wonderful product that keeps me enjoying the clicks without any noise. No headache of battery life. Recharge and go mouse that signals more than 10meters distance. The color attracts and keeps me cool during operation.,47,5.0,2021,07,July,03
"Thought it was a great idea, but ...",8,"My granddaughter wanted this wireless mouse for her computer. It is SILENT when clicking. She likes that the colors change on the side when using it. Overall, she is happy with it.",32,1.0,2021,07,July,03

Very nice mouse!,3,Like this mouse work good,5,5.0,2021,07,July,02
Not sure,2,"It's exactly as bad as I should have expected for the price. I've had it for 3 days and it will randomly stop working. I have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again. The plastic it's made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture. Honestly, I should have spent a few more bucks and bought something better.",68,3.0,2021,07,July,02
Works great,2,I like my new mouse. I needed an inexpensive yet durable mouse and this one has been great so far. I have only used it for a day but so far so good. Great purchase.,35,4.0,2021,07,July,02
Good product,2,"It's a cool mouse, but I don't think it's worth the price. Whenever I use it, my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use. It's not my computer's fault because I switched mouses and the other one works fine. Also, the color changing lights are see-through from the top (I got a white one) and it kind of ruins the feel. It just feels really cheap. Honestly though, if it was maybe $5 cheaper and it didn't glitch the curser I'd say it's worth it. I like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries, and I like how it comes with a lightning USB adapter.",113,5.0,2021,07,July,02
Works with apple computers too,5,"Love this little guy! The colors are fun, they change everytime the mouse moves! Helps you to remember to turn it off! Easy to charge with USB, glides smooth! Totally love it!",32,5.0,2021,07,July,02
Best mouse I ever purchased,5,"Worked great for a month. Mouse connects via a USB receiver. I've only disconnected the receiver a few times when not using the mouse. However, after disconnecting a few times, I can't reconnect the receiver without it being ""loose"": the instant my mouse connects, it will disconnect because the USB is too loose now. After a MONTH.Edit: Customer service reps have reached out to me, offering me money to delete my review.",72,5.0,2021,07,July,01
Definitely a  miss for me.,5,"I like the change in color but this is definitely not a gaming mouse. I needed an alternative to keep me in the works so I chose something that was cheap and nice looking. Its silent and has a nice speed to it, not too much sensitivity.",47,1.0,2021,07,July,01
Beautiful design!,2,"This Mouse was Amazing when i first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months. Then i started having connecting issues, so i direct hooked it up to my PC and it worked like that for a Day. Now it Doesnt work at all. Dont Waste your money on this.",53,5.0,2021,07,July,01
Cheap!,1,I needed a wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop. This mouse exceeded my expectations. I love the that it lights up and comes in a variety of colors. It's kinda hard to find a silver mouse especially one that is compatible with a Type  C usb so I am happy.,55,1.0,2021,07,July,01

Looks and feels good,4,Wasn’t sure I’d like the smooth style of the mouse but I love it! Gonna buy one in another color as a backup just incase,25,5.0,2021,07,July,01

Works great.,2,"*Update* Since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering a $10 refund if I took the review down. When I didn’t reply they offered me a $30 refund (?) again in return I would have to remove the review. They stated they were a small company and my review was hurting them… but with over 15,000 reviews, I don’t see how that’s possible…The light goes off like it is charged, however, it won’t turn on more than about 10 seconds. I’ve tried 2 different charging cords and same thing happens. Don’t waste your money.",96,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Not for someone who works for more than an hour at a time on the computer.,16,"This was gifted to me as I was in need of a better mouse for working at home. Very comfortable to hold, able to right-click and easy set up. No issues, highly recommend this mouse.",35,1.0,2021,06,June,28

Great!,1,It is ergonomic and love the color.  It works well and is pretty quiet when clicking and scrolling.,18,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Cheap and waste of money,5,"Basically bought this for work.  Very light, which is good to use for.  Don’t have to fight with the wired mouse anymore.  Like the light that comes with it, goes with a good gaming system.Overall very well built.",38,1.0,2021,06,June,28
This mouse started off OK,5,"I wish the charger was longer it’s so short. I used it once and the mouse was not calibrated. I had to bang it a couple of times then it worked. Buying a new one, I do not recommend this product.",41,1.0,2021,06,June,28
Love this mouse!,3,The photo is misleading. Only one color shows at a time.  Mouse is not as accurate as most.,18,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Fun rechargeable low profile mouse with RGB lights.,8,"This mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews. It is light, good to hold, and has good battery life. It is also quiet (with exceptions–see below)Its main problem however is that the middle button (the scrollwheel) becomes unusable after only a short amount of use. After which, the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register a button press.Also, compared to the LMB & RMB buttons (which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally), the MMB is extremely rigid in comparison. It is also very noisy, which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent. It is much more noisy than other mice I have used (which is about 20).As someone who relies on this button during daily usage, this is very frustrating, and frankly a serious design flaw. I'd like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well (i.e, not rough). I also bought the non-LED version of this mouse, and the *exact same problem* appeared after the same amount of time.Another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low, leaving one to guess when to recharge it.It often becomes erratic (mouse pointer moves around) and does not register movement well, requiring a power cycle. This is occuring on more than one system.All in all a decent attempt, but quite a few issues need to be ironed out. I doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than a couple of weeks usage, as these issues are consistent and appeared after 2-3 months.Frankly, I expect a mouse to last _significantly longer_, and also have a useable middle mouse button. I hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer.",289,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Great product!,2,"UPDATE: I have been sent 4 emails from the seller begging me to change my review, 2 of the emails offered me $40 to do so. This explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product.the mouse freezes constantly. left and right click will work but the mouse will not move. this is the worst mouse i've ever had. it also goes into sleep mode after 10 minutes of not being used, which is annoying and no way to turn it off. the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn't make sense. the charge doesn't last very long at all, charging it every couple of days.",108,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Works with Ease,3,I like this for school,5,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Super Awesome Mouse,3,It stopped working after about 2 weeks even after being fully charged.,12,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Needs to Charge,3, I just live my cordless keyboard and mouse. They match my HP desktop computer perfectly.,15,3.0,2021,06,June,27
Durable,1,"The Good- looks nice and feels good in your hand. The Bad- the right click button is too sensitive, I'm constantly opening up the right click menu. The pointer freezes and I have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it. The Ugly- I ordered a silver mouse and I got dark gray.",55,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Stopped working,2,"So for anyone wondering, charging it is easy. If you plug it and the light in the middle is blue, that means that it is not fully charged. The blue light will turn off after being fully charged. Mine arrived on Monday and on Wednesday it turned off. I plugged it in and took around 2.5 hours to charge it (the light turned off). The clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use. One thing I do not like is the ""scroller,"" which can be a little too hard (I tend to open many tabs at once, at work and while I am on Pinterest lol) but that's just me. Overall, is a nice mouse and I hope it can stay with me forever (this is my 4th mouse in less than a year).",135,1.0,2021,06,June,27

right mouse button doesn't always work.,6,I needed an ultraslim mouse for my laptop and this one works great. My only complaint (if you can call it that) is its length. It would fit better in my carry case if it were shorter.,37,5.0,2021,06,June,27

Not so good,3,"Came charged. Has an off, on, and then the color switch. Quiet quick. My favorite mode is that when it’s idle for a while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life. Exactly what I wanted. Easy USB charge. Hope it lasts me for a while!!",51,1.0,2021,06,June,25
Waste of money,3,"I bought two of these to use with our laptops. Both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily.

Not sure how this got so many 5-stars,8,"The major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent. It lasts only about 2 hours for me.

First impression,2," Feels good in my hand and works well. The roller wheel works as a third button which is important for my work. Colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that's a bonus. It charges so no batteries and I'm loving that. The only issue I'm finding is that it goes to sleep very fast. If you wait to long to move it, you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel. Not a big deal just annoying sometimes. Overall I'm happy with it.",90,3.0,2021,06,June,22
Wireless Mouse,2,It came really fast. I got it in one day! It is really sleek and works really smooth. I chose my favorite color of course but I love all the colors the light goes through! I also really like that it has a button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light! And of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries.

Love it,2,"I have had this mouse for all of 15 minutes and I am planning on returning it.Honestly it looks nice and I like that it's rechargable.However, it's easily one of the worst I've ever used (I've used probably 50 different models in my career alone). First, clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse I've used and on top of that it's very inconsistent. Looking through the gaps where the LEDs show out of I can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is a tiny plastic arm. No chance that will lasts for an expected period of time.It seemed to have been packaged fine, so I don't believe it was damaged or DOA.Don't buy this.",120,5.0,2021,06,June,20

Cool mouse,2,"I needed a wireless mouse for my new laptop and found this to be a reasonable price.  It is a great design, usb dongle can mount under the mouse itself for travel so you don’t lose it, as it is very compact (which is really nice for a laptop).  Has two modes, one is “on” and the other mode is on with color.  It’s nice to have the option as to be able to save battery life.  The mouse clicks are silent which was a different experience for me, but it’s nice.  It does go into standby mode if not used to save battery and takes a couple seconds to “wake up” but to me this is better than killing the battery.  All in all this was a good purchase!",130,5.0,2021,06,June,19
Stays charged for a long time,6,"For the price this mouse is quite good. Top of the mouse is soft touch material. It is comfortable to use( not too big or small). I also like color of the  light that always changes while I am using the mouse. I am using this mouse for 3 months, my daughter have not broken it yet lol.",58,5.0,2021,06,June,19
Great for price,3,"This mouse feels great in your hands. You don't have to worry about it being difficult to click or scroll, as the placement of the buttons are all easy to use and find.

Good mouse,2,"It’s cute & pink & is just like the picture! It’s a really nice mouse, but I’m sad that it doesn’t work with my iPad.

Yes,1,"Mouse only worked half the time, then never held a charge.",11,5.0,2021,06,June,18
Cute and easy on my hand.,6,**Update**After using the mouse for around 4 days it just completely stopped working. The lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn't pick up any movement. Don't even bother with this. It's trash.Not a very reliable mouse.  After just a couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating. I wouldn't purchase again. That said it is a very quiet mouse with no audible click and it's a good size.,83,5.0,2021,06,June,18

I am using it on a Samasung Galaxy Pro 360, expensive computer cheap mouse. It works perfectly.I do have two concerns. It's cheap, looks cheap, and the color looks to me as it will fade in time.Second, the dongle sticks out alot. Too much for my liking.That said, this computer doesn't need a mouse, I just wanted one for laziness purposes.The product is as stated, but cheap. Great for a college student or a travel mouse.",103,3.0,2021,06,June,17

Lights will die after a day!!!!!!!!!,6,"I like the overall design.  The slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive.Where I'm struggling with this mouse is that as I'm trying to work, there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen.  Also, trying to hold and highlight a group of text, for some reason it loses connection.  what I've ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my Shift+Arrow Keys to highlight the text that I need.For general web browsing, this mouse isn't bad.  For productivity, it's not really working for me and i'm going to go back to my wired mouse.",108,1.0,2021,06,June,09

Great!!!!,1,Hi love it but I bought it because it changed colors and it only stays on red.,17,5.0,2022,06,June,04
Sub par Quality,3,"This is a great mouse to have if you are trying to have a mouse that can be used on a type c only device while keeping the option of normal USB open. I love having it light up and it's cool thing to have in my office. If you want to use the type c port. It will need to be attached via adapter. The adapter will stick out unfortunately so be careful as you can damage the adapter. It does have a slot so you can install the dongle (not the adapter) to the mouse itself. The default plug is just a normal USB port. The mouse feels pretty nice. It does feels pretty smooth. There is no real lag or drifting with this mouse. It does have a built in battery which is super nice. You are able to just recharge the mouse by plugging it directly into your laptop via micro USB. I was able to use it for quite some time before the battery died and initial charging only took a about 4 hours. It does have a sleep mode from what I can tell to save battery life when you are not using it but it does have an ON and OFF button if you need it. The mouse moves pretty well across most surfaces and clicking is pretty responsive. Im not a gamer,, so can't give any recommendations on that.. The LED light works pretty well with the color. You can adjust the color via the center button. The bottom has pads but they are not the soft silicone like pads. It feels like a hard material. This is a plug in play and works great with mac and PC. It does not look like it has a way of adjusting the DPI but it has a pretty good default DPI already so I do not see the need to adjust it. Overall I think this is a great mouse.",327,1.0,2021,06,June,15
GREAT DEAL,2,Bought on prime day for a great price. It was easy to sync to my laptop. Comfortable grip.  I have been using for a couple of days the charge lasted longer than expected. Functions wonderfully. I did not use it for gaming so I can not accurately rate that.,49,5.0,2021,06,June,15

That is what the star is for, the pretty lights.",69,4.0,2021,06,June,10
Cool Mouse but doesn't work smoothly,6,"When I received this item it was thin, which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side. Then, I simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered!

Top of the line.,4,"At first I loved this mouse, it worked great and the battery lasted a long time.

Great for price,3,"Okay, here we go..  I was really excited to get this and try it out. I want to note that I wasn't expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive; however, my excitement didn't last long. The dpi will not change on the one I got, so I changed my mouse settings on my PC. This very, VERY minimally helped. -I couldn't help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic......ccccck!For some, this may fit comfortably in their hand, but not mine. Also, it goes to ""sleep"" QUICKLY - as in 5.6 seconds quick. Yes, I timed it.Unfortunately, I'll have to try to return this since I won't use it... ever. By ""try to return it,"" I mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office (or wherever I need to take it) because that never actually happens.In closing, if you have small hands, you're looking for a super slick (meaning super fast) mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi, you'll only use it once... maybe twice a year, and you're good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned, then go for it! Otherwise, maybe look into a different one. Also, I gave 2 stars since is was inexpensive.",214,5.0,2021,06,June,08

Great product Great value,4,The mouse was surprisingly lightweight. I am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes a huge difference. It is super sensitive too. I was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue. My old mouse required a mouse pad. The lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off. The USB receiver was easily found underneath. It was a bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick. It also comes with the USB c adapter which you don't see often but I believe it would work with a Chromebook? or maybe with a USB c charger? It has everything I need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is!,139,5.0,2021,06,June,03
Light weight and easy to handle,6,"I really like this mouse, I just wish I had a way to know what the battery was at or when it is getting low.",25,5.0,2021,06,June,02
Looks good but not a long term purchase,8,The shape is great and the charge really last. unfortunately after 3 months of use the USB connector has stopped working and the USB charger does not connect to the computer it only charges,34,4.0,2021,06,June,02
NICE EASY OPERATE MOUSE,4,exactly what i thought it was gonna be! i use this at work and although the sleep mode can be annoying it does it’s job!,25,5.0,2021,06,June,02
Great product!,2,Liked the sleek design and that it lights up ☺️,10,5.0,2021,06,June,02

No Laptop Should Be With This,6,Super cute and so easy to use! I love that it’s so slim too!,14,5.0,2021,06,June,01
Sux,1,"First, I removed  the charging cable from the box and found that the wire was broken and I figured I could find another cable but then I pulled out the mouse and it was broken as well. The top half of the mouse was broken off from the bottom half. Needless to say I returned the product for a refund.",60,2.0,2021,06,June,01
Very cute but cheap quality,5,"Good enough for the price, but very awkward to handle. Middle mouse button is hard to push and often doesn't actually get pushed despite making the sound.",27,3.0,2021,06,June,01
Great Product,2,"Worked right out of the packaging, cute, inexpensive",8,5.0,2021,06,June,01
Very pleased with product,4,"I recently picked up a new computer and needed a new mouse - one that would fit the bill for my work editing video. It needed to be light, ergonomic and move well with sensitivity. I also work in low light and the LED light on the mouse is a nice touch. The LED is certainly not an essential feature, but it definitely adds a nice look to the product, and for me is very appealing. This mouse has been great all around. I recommend this product.Edit: Initially I loved this mouse, however its ability to maintain a charge dramatically decreased in short order. It can no longer keep a charge for more than an hour or so. The mouse has essentially become useless. This is quite a disappointment after initially enjoying the other qualities of this mouse.",138,5.0,2021,06,June,01
Don’t buy!!!,2,"This mouse works like a charm, it is beautiful. The changing colors are fantastically fun!  This fits nicely in my backpack for use with my laptop.",26,1.0,2021,06,June,01
Awful,1,I had my mouse for about a week and after using it maybe 5 times. It completely stopped moving around. Only things that works on it is the buttons and the wheel,32,1.0,2021,06,June,01
Worked perfectly fine until it broke.,6,"Awesome and cool, the color turns red when it's time to plug in and recharge.",15,2.0,2021,05,May,31
Glowing Mouse,2,"I love how you don't need a battery , just recharge it! Great and colorfull!",15,5.0,2021,05,May,31
Easy to operate but...,4,Great wireless mouse.  The instructions were easy to follow.  The only thing I wish it did was glow red when it needs recharging.  I will probably purchase another one when this one dies.,33,4.0,2021,05,May,31
As described,2,Love how it looks and feels but out the box it was really glitchy. I charged it and saw that it was still sticking a bit as I was using it. Since it's a mouse the one thing it should do is move smoothly ya know? I don't know if this was just this one mouse or it's how it runs. Either way it's really annoying when you're trying to get things done.,73,5.0,2021,05,May,31
Satisfied customer!,2,"I was looking to buy a portable mouse for travel, and was going to buy a regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option. I really like the mint green color. It’s affordable, easy to use, connects fast, and very low profile. The clicker is quiet too. Scroller works great as well. I charged it up connected via USB to my dock station and it was ready to go. Love it.",74,5.0,2021,05,May,31
Garbage,1,Used for daily use. Nice product,6,1.0,2021,05,May,30
Nice wireless mouse,3,The mouse is light weight and I like the colors. It is also smooth and charge lasts for a while. However I just bought it in May and today in August the usb broke off in the usb port of my computer. The metal part detached from the plastic part. Disappointed.,51,4.0,2021,05,May,30
Great product,2,So I bought this a few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday (6/8/21) the color changing lights worked and now (6/9/21) only the red light works. This is bs!!! I turned it off for 40 mins to give it a rest but nope the lights still don’t work 2/10 don’t recommend,57,5.0,2021,05,May,30
It's silent,2,"Very glitch-y.  Curser tracking is not smooth at all.  Silent buttons are almost too sensitive and frequently ""click"" when I'm not meaning to do so.I threw out this item after only 3 days.",33,5.0,2021,05,May,30
Not the best mouse out there.,6,"Gorgeous and very affordable. The battery doesn't last very long, but it's easy to charge while using.",17,3.0,2021,05,May,30
Broke within a week,4,"I was so happy with this mouse when I first got it. Very comfortable, loved the light and most of all the wireless feature. The love affair however was short-lived. After using the mouse for only 2 months it stopped working. I would charge it, it would run for 5 minutes then dead again. It got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if I kept it plugged - therefore defeating the wireless feature.",79,1.0,2021,05,May,29
The best mouse,3,"Love the design. After two weeks, it has started to fail again (this is my 2nd one). Hoping it's just a fluke!",22,5.0,2021,05,May,29
Disappointed with product. Unable to return for replacement.,8,"This mouse was purchased for use with my laptop. I've purchased two of the same brand previously, but wanted something different so I took a chance on this unknown. The mouse is light, and ergonomic - I have a fairly small hand and it fits well. Connection was simple. The sleep mode will definitely increase battery life. Add to this the pretty lights, and lovely rose color...I'm pleasantly surprised! I would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive, and uncomplicated, addition to their setup.",86,2.0,2021,05,May,29
Bad batteries,2,Size is just right for me,6,2.0,2021,05,May,29
I loved this mouse until...,5,"I like that it recharges and doesn't require batteries.  It doesn't last that long though.  but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even 5 minutes.  I wish it came with a longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in  ( still can, but very short cord)",57,1.0,2021,05,May,29
BEST MOUSE,2,No batteries needed. This works great and it lites up too. Easy to charge and use. No problems at all.,20,5.0,2021,05,May,29

Best mouse I have ever I used.,7,"The product fits well in my hand and has a quiet click but it keeps on cutting out. I will walk away for a minute and the mouse does not work anymore so I have to unplug it, turn it off, then back on and replug it in.",48,5.0,2021,05,May,28
Love it!,2,I travel for work so this wireless mouse is perfect. It’s small for packing away and the sleep mode keeps it going longer. I charge it about every 2-3 days.,30,4.0,2021,05,May,28

Great mouse but color isn’t accurate,6,It works great! I love it! My son uses it aswell for roblox,13,4.0,2021,05,May,27
Very pretty junk!,3,"The color wasn’t like the photo. It’s a bit darker than what I was expecting (see photo for reference). I did love that the mouse came with a USB to USB-C adapter. The part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was “stuck” so I had to use excessive force to remove it. Only other thing I could change is the LED colors. It goes through series of colors, but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be.",85,1.0,2021,05,May,27
This is perfect!!!,3, I love the fact that this thing is quiet as a mouse(Lol).  I hate the clicking sound on other mouses.  The other thing I love is that it's rechargeable! No batteries.  The only con I could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse.  That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.,55,5.0,2021,05,May,27
omg so smoooth,3,IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME TO CHARGE THE MOUSE AS TO USE IT.  NOT PRACTICAL.  OTHERWISE THE MOUSE WORKSand it is  ERGONOMICAL,22,5.0,2021,05,May,27

Not upgraded,2,"Quite, cute and very portable",5,1.0,2021,05,May,26
Missing cable,2,"I was looking for a mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one.  I am pleasantly surprised by this mouse.  The click is very quiet yet there is a satisfying tactile feel to it, though the right click can be a bit sensitive but nothing too major. I think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable.  Very convenient.  The mouse can be used while charging and only took about 1.5 hours to fully charge.  There is a led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging.  The mouse will also go into sleep mode after 10 minutes of inactivity to save power.  Overall, great mouse.",124,3.0,2021,05,May,26
bought less than a month ago- already failing,8,"I researched Amazon for a wireless mouse and found this one.  I bought it to use with a new laptop.  It works great.

Did not last long,4,"Beautiful but not sturdy. It comes with a warning ""do not drop"" , well I dropped it...twice! Ugh. It totally won't work now.

I only have this for less than a year,9,"Tried on multiple surface and no matter what i do, the pointer is erratic.  It also NEVER goes into sleep mode.  If you fail to turn it off, you will run through the battery in a day.  Awful.  Tried to click on the seller name in an effort to contact them directly, but it was grayed out.  Very disappointed.",59,2.0,2021,05,May,24

"LED Wireless Mouse, Rechargeable Slim Silent Mouse 2.4G Portable Mobile Optical",11,purchased this March 29th 2021 only lasted 2 months.Was great while it worked but then 2 days ago it just stopped working.I thought I somehow plugged it in wrong and it didn't charge so charged it back up for two days.Went to use it today and after 30 min it stopped working again. I only use this for work. It doesn't get tossed around in a backpack or anything it just sits on my desk and is used 8 hrs a day 5 days a week and is plugged back in at the end of the work day and died in 2 months.,103,3.0,2021,05,May,23
Works like a dream,4,"Very cheaply made. It was the biggest waste of my money. The piece that plugs into the USB port broke in a weeks time as I was taking it out of the port. It can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it. I dont know that its worth it. I guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed.It was pretty cool how it lights up. It is very lightweight as well, which I will leave that to your own interpretation.",126,5.0,2021,05,May,22
Ultra slim ergonomic design.,4,I use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing... but does what it’s supposed to do.. great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand,32,5.0,2021,05,May,22

Would buy it again,4,Great product and very happy with my purchase. Quiet buttons when pressed and love the different color lights.,18,5.0,2021,05,May,21
Almost worthless!,2,"Product worked great for 1st 3 months, now the USB charging port is bad and since it's a rechargable mouse it's useless now. Led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks. Being optical vs laser, it isn't for gaming and battery wouldn't last all day clicking. It also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into a hassle.",77,1.0,2021,05,May,21
Decent mouse,2,"easy to use, lightweight and comfortable to the hand...",9,2.0,2021,05,May,21
Cute but Sucks,3,Easy to use with a sleek design.,7,1.0,2021,05,May,21

Wish would have got years ago,6,The mouse is very cute and i love the colors and the way it lights up. I went to use it one day and it was out of charge (I charged it). I doubt this will last long. It was $15 but really worth about  $5.,46,5.0,2021,05,May,20

Edited:  I Do Like Product,5,This mouse was awful!! It worked for a few minutes and then stopped working. You’d have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for a minute. I changed the battery twice. Do not purchase.,39,4.0,2021,05,May,19
No batteries needed,3,"I loved this product but, when I went to remove it from the usb slot, the inner part broke off inside the computer.",23,5.0,2021,05,May,19
Love it!,2,"I have already ordered the black one and liked it so much, I orderer another one for my laptop!",19,5.0,2021,05,May,19
Product works well at first...,5,"The device looks and feels good.  The left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click.  The coloring is good looking, but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge.  the short charging cord connects to the computer, so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse, which is inconvenient.  but the control of the curser is good, although occasionally it seems to ""jump"" to a different place on the screen...still not sure why that happens.  But it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it's ""quirks.""",117,2.0,2021,05,May,19
It's Not Bluetooth!,3,As described,2,3.0,2021,05,May,19
Easy to Use and very comfortable mouse,7,I read a lot of the reviews before I decide to buy this item.  So far I have no regrets. People complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on.  So when I got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights. If you think about it you are saving power when your not using it.  I would recommend the product.,67,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Cool Mouse,2,I got 4 of these and so far 2 have been returned. They work until they need charged and then they stop working.  Don't waste your money!,27,5.0,2021,05,May,18

Great for fire tablet,4,No complaint!,2,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Excellent mouse.  price quality.,4,Actually changed my mind on this mouse. The one I was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud. I broke this one out of the box and it's pretty cool. It changes colors and it's silent. I can work with the size being slimer.,48,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Works as promised,3,The cord going into for charging doesn’t fit exactly right. Seems cheaply made. Wouldn’t buy this brand again.,18,5.0,2021,05,May,17

Already useless,2,Cable quit charging mouse after one charge!,7,1.0,2021,05,May,17
Stopped working after one month,5,It charged up the first time and didn’t charge up again after that. And the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself. Very cool looking tho.,29,1.0,2021,05,May,17
"Worked great, until right after the return window closed.... ** UPDATED REVIEW**",12,I've had this mouse for almost 2 weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed a loud grinding a popping sound every time you use it. I will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else.,43,1.0,2021,05,May,17
Squeaky wheel,2,"This is the first mouse I have bought for my new PC, probably the best purchase I have made for my PC. It's great to use anywhere, it's so quiet and smooth looking, It fits in the palm of my hand nicely, the colors are a bit off but great for how cheap it was! I really like that It was cheap too, but it wasn't cheaply made or seemed like it. I 9/10 recommend! It was a bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my PC, I do have both USBC and USB on here but keep in mind that if you have a USB PC you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse, its hard to get it out of though! DO SAVE THE BOX FOR THE USBC CONNECTOR AND CHARGER!",139,3.0,2021,05,May,17

This is a great item!,5,I really love this mouse. I bought it for my office to get rid of the cords. The colors are nice and I like that it goes to sleep when not in use. I've gotten many compliments on it.,39,5.0,2021,05,May,15
Headache from colors,3,Looks & feels great! Love all the colors!,8,2.0,2021,05,May,15
Clicking is actually silent 🤐,5,"I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I love the matte feel, and the lights. Its also very quiet and not clicky, I wasn't expecting that for the price!The only issue I have is that if you use it with a laptop and remove the receiver often, the receiver will come apart. Im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together (with glue??, idk) whenever I take it out, the USB drive and the black part separate, and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens. Frustrating. Will say that it lasted a couple months before that happened though.. if you use it with a pc and never remove it,, itll last longer.. i just wish I could get a replacement receiver; I don't want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it. I got it in February 2021 and I noticed that it glitches a bit if its not on a mouse pad or about to die, which can be annoying but manageable;the mouse charges very quickly!",186,5.0,2021,05,May,15
Just buy it! 😍,4,"I really like this item, it is a lot better than the other ones I was using, great for gaming, charges quickly and easy to get started with and It fits my small hand perfectly. Would definitely recommend this product.",40,5.0,2021,05,May,15
I like this mouse,4,"I absolutely love this mouse! Super handy dandy because not only does it work with my Mac it also works with my work laptop which is a dell. The only thing I don’t like about it is that if you don’t use it for a while, it shuts off. I mean it’s great because it saves energy so you don’t have to charge it often but meh. I’ve yet to charge it again. I used it for 2 days for at least 10 hours each day.",86,4.0,2021,05,May,14
Low quality mice,3,Clicking the right and left stick and it's is slow to catch click. Cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for. Cute yes.. but not worth the frustration.,32,1.0,2021,05,May,14
Beautiful lights and quiet mouse that works great,8,The mouse worked fine for the few minutes i got to use it. The USB charging cord was missing. Per the instructions you cannot use any other charging cord with it.,31,5.0,2021,05,May,14
Fun but won’t hold charge,5,"This is the best wireless mouse I've ever used.  The flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use.  The colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive.  If you plan to use it with a desktop computer, be aware that the charging cord is very short, so using the mouse while charging may be a problem.  I use it with a laptop, where this is not an obstacle.  The mouse appears very well made and sturdy.",84,1.0,2021,05,May,12
lights,1,"Works good for a child, not  for people with arthritis",10,5.0,2021,05,May,12
Good while it lasted,4,Very cool design thanks,4,1.0,2022,05,May,31
You,1,"It's light and the texture is nice but there are a few flaws. The mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there's a lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table. The mouse is small, which is nice for portability, but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after a while. The battery charge is good and the lights aren't too harsh. But by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn't maintain a constant mouse button press. So if you have to hold and drag something, it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed. I tested this a lot and it always, without fail stops holding down on the computer. This is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons. Perhaps I just received a faulty mouse, but for the price it's hard to complain too much.",160,5.0,2021,05,May,14
DOES NOT WORK,3,Absolutely amazing product! I cant get use it enough especially with the color light feature. The scroll bar is very smooth and the mouse itself fits perfectly in your hand.

Love It!,2,"I bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it.  Then, she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse.  I left my mouse at work and borrowed this one.  Now I know why she doesn’t use it.  It constantly disconnects and I have to turn it on and off to get it to work.  Then, it randomly tracks on the screen when I am not moving it...it seems like someone else is controlling my computer.  Unsettling.  This mouse is junk...very pretty junk.",88,4.0,2021,05,May,13

Disappointing,1,Perfect fit to my hand and matches my headphones!!,9,1.0,2021,05,May,13
Works great,2,"We bought this as a replacement for our son, for school work. He had the old version and it worked really well, but he dropped it one to many times and broke (lasted @ 1yr).  This one @a couple weeks into school work the cursor started to drift for no reason. My son is in the 5th grade, no drops, tried several differ backgrounds. Nothing worked, so my husband tried out the mouse, still does not work. Not upgraded, waisted our money and frustrated the whole house withe the uncontrollable drift.",91,5.0,2021,05,May,13
Bad Mouse dont buy,4,Did not receive the correct cable to charge.,8,1.0,2021,05,May,13
Works great only one hiccup,5,"Started out pretty nice but after 3.5 weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly. Even after charging all night, after about 3 minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.Update: The vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for $30- I'm guessing they don't want me to write this on the review but I've told them no three times now and they just sent another one.  I've told them that it's unethical. I've told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place. And there's another one in my inbox. *sigh* I guess I just forward another one to the Customer Service Department of AMazon.",116,4.0,2021,05,May,13

Nice small looks cool,4,I am pleasantly pleased with this mouse. It’s attractive looking and works very well. It comes with a USB C adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one. Plug and play actually worked. No complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if I need an additional one.,51,5.0,2021,05,May,12
Love the shiny black with the lights flashing,8,This mouse works well for my needs and fits in my (medium-sized) hands well. This is the first mouse I've ever owned with a built-in rechargeable battery and now I don't ever want to own one without it. The small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go. Another nicely designed element is that the nano-receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn't require prying off a cover or any extra effort to remove or insert.,83,5.0,2021,05,May,12
Great for every day use.,5,"I love this color-changing wireless mouse!! I’m a colorful person, so I recognize colors before recognizing plain black and white. As an educator, my office is colorful, and my classroom was colorful too!! LOVE IT!!!!",35,4.0,2021,05,May,11
Finally a comfortable mouse,4,I love this mouse. It’s VERY smooth. If I had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don’t plug it up before you leave work. But sometimes I just forget to plug it up when I leave so that’s my fault.,49,3.0,2021,05,May,11

Poor quality and didn't work.,5,"I gave it two stars because I like glowing lights (can you tell I’m a child of the 80s?); if I could give it zero stars for function, I would. This mouse has a lot of good reviews - maybe mine is a fluke. It is, however, fairly horrible. The charge on the battery is extraordinarily short-lived and when charged, it sort of sucks then too.",66,1.0,2021,05,May,10
Quality responsive mouse,3,"Really disappointed with this product. I loved it when I got it. It fit my hand nicely worked like a dream, then it came time to charge it.

Not worth it.",61,4.0,2021,05,May,08

Cheap,1,"8/30/2021- Wanted to update my review. Not only did this not last AT ALL I have received MULTIPLE emails from the distributor asking to remove my review, promising an amazon gift card. They gave multiple excuses of why the item doesn't work. Clearly from all the recent reviews of this item, they have not fixed any of it. I get almost daily emails from them asking to remove my review. DO NOT buy this item, you will regret it!I was loving this mouse. Sleek design. Loved the rechargeable feature of it. Until one day I came into work, booted up my laptop and the mouse was no longer connecting to the computer. Tried to take out the USB of the computer, and part of it was left stuck in the computer. I am now going to have to try to get the piece out of the usb port on my laptop. And how about that, my return window ended last week. VERY frustrated and annoyed by this. I would not recommend this item.",173,2.0,2021,05,May,06
Crazy mouse!,2,The mouse does well. I use it daily for work. It lasts a long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when I am not using it so battery is not wasted. Sometimes I can go 2 weeks without charging. My only complaint is the wheel. I have had it about 4 months and the wheel started squeaking recently. People can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts. This is my 3rd wireless mouse (the other 2 were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all- was a common complaint on those).,98,1.0,2021,05,May,06

"This is a new, better model of an external muse for laptop",12,"Love the slimline appearance and the changing colors. The colors add a sense of fun to a normally mundane piece of computer equipment. Also love the ability to keep it one color (red) or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor. Good product, well designed. Make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on/off switch, but has three positions. THIS IS NOW OCTOBER 2021, This mouse broke after little use while traveling. The scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless. This appears to be a poor design and a weak point in this item and I would now not recommend it.

I don't plan on using the mouse for gaming so I will not know how well it works for that sort of thing.. for me just basic computer work, Photoshop & Lightroom and I think it will do nicely for those.. it seems quick and is working well even without a mouse pad.

Well Crafted .. ..,4,This mouse is very quiet like it says in the description. Pretty. The only thing I worry about is it is very lightweight. The quality seems cheap. But it hasn’t proved that yet.

It works and its really pretty,6,Its really light weight and you don't hear the mouse clicks. However the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse.  I didn't have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out.  Logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn't have a visible battery.  So I used the tip of a knife to pop the usb out.  Almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out.  You may do a better job than me.,86,5.0,2021,05,May,01
Fells good in your hand and pretty smooth.,8,"There's really nothing to dislike about it, I love the fact that I don't have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it's not going to work. The way it charges is one of the main reasons that I bought it. I'd rather save the $$ for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if I have enough spare batteries. I have a mouse pad that has a ""breathing"" mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts. For the amount spent, I'd give this mouse a 10+. I also love the fact that it's easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying (again) if my mouse will run out of power. I think that there should be more accessories that can charge from a USB port rather than lugging around extra batteries.",158,4.0,2021,05,May,01
"Overall Meh, It's usable but not my fave",8,Great item kids love it,5,3.0,2021,05,May,01
You either have one or you need one!!!!,8,It works nicely.,3,5.0,2021,05,May,01
This mouse works great,4,Looks cool,2,5.0,2021,05,May,01
Mouse for laptop,3,"This mouse is cute and convenient. Not heavy, the shiny black color looks nice against the colors and it is quiet. Works fine with my macbook air. The only thing is that the usb adaptor it comes with, is very hard to insert it into the c port that it comes. But besides that, everything works fine.",57,5.0,2021,04,April,30
Pretty good,2,"Used mouse for less than a week. It will not hold charge. Used for less than 2 hours this morning after charging for 24 hours and it’s now dead. But when it worked I loved it! It was light, quiet, and very colorful.",43,4.0,2021,04,April,30
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!,4,"This is an awesome mouse!  It is a slender build so it fits a small hand & the lights are totally fun.  When you click the buttons, it is a strong click so that you know you have clicked on something, it, also, has a quick response on the computer.  It has an off & on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won't use up the batteries.  I will be buying one for my daughter, it is awesome.",80,5.0,2021,04,April,30
What a fun mouse,4,"I find this mouse easy to use, fits my hand very well (wear a medium sized glove) and moves fairly smoothly.  I say fairly smooth because I used a mouse pad with a smooth soft surface.  It seemed to drag just a little. When I tried a smooth hard surface it worked better.  You do have to click a button to ""wake up"" the mouse when it goes to sleep mode.  My other one woke up with just moving it.  I thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but I dont even notice it.  I would probably buy again.",104,5.0,2021,04,April,30
"Works fine, seems cheaply made",5,My hand doesn't cramp using it. WIN!Update: Wheel in mouse won't scroll. Sadness,13,3.0,2021,04,April,29
Works very well and I like that it is rechargeable.,10,Broke within a week,4,4.0,2021,04,April,29
Bad mouse,2,I wanted it without the dongle,6,1.0,2021,04,April,29
Great!,1,"The mouse functions well, I especially like the colorful lights, however, the battery is kind of a pain. It lasts for only 1.5 days, even when it is in sleep mode. I have to remember to charge it everyday, which unfortunately I am not good at. I ended up using my old mouse as a backup every a few days.",60,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Good buy,2,"Really disappointed. I wanted to love this product, but the USB-C adapter that came with it doesn’t fit into my USB-C port. It looks like it only goes half way in. So basically the product is useless :(The mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate. Wish the adapter worked",50,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Quiet and stylish,3,My home schooling student enjoyed the lights but it has stopped working entirely after 4 months. Too late to return. So fun for awhile but don't expect it to last.,30,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Stopped working after a week,5,"I love this mouse so much I bought another one. I love the soft click, that it is rechargeable, and the lights are great. Easy to install, just stick the USB dongle into the computer and Starr using. Probably the best mouse I’ve had.",44,1.0,2021,04,April,29
Great product,2,"Item must’ve been defective or something because in 2 was it stopped working, charging and pretty much would o my work at will.Also the returns process with this vendor sucks. It’s not via Amazon. Had to go twice to UPS because I had to print the label or pay $3.50 to print on site. Then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in.If I would’ve paid a little bit more for a higher quality, would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle. Save yourself the grief and get one a little bit more upscale.",101,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Stopped working after less than a day,7,Didn't work.,2,1.0,2021,04,April,29

👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽,1,Smooth clicking.  Ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use.,15,5.0,2021,04,April,29
That it works,3,"Comfortable and sleek, great for traveling.  Love the colors running around it!",12,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Super cool!,2,I bought this for my new laptop because I really don't like the finger pads on laptops.It is truly plug-and-play and works awesome! plus it looks really sleek.,28,5.0,2021,04,April,28
USB-C adapter included!!!!,3,Nice colorful LED mouse that is still tethered to a cord when in use for a while,17,4.0,2021,04,April,28
Cute,1,The wheel/roller makes click vibrations and makes scrolling take longer. I would love it otherwise.,15,5.0,2021,04,April,28
Best WiFi Mouse,3,Stopped working a day and a half after I got it. I’ve charged it and everything and it just won’t work. Good for the couple of hours that I did use it I thought the lights were pretty. So I give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was a waste of my money since it no longer works.,65,5.0,2021,04,April,28
You get what you pay for,6,Greatest,1,3.0,2021,04,April,28

Don't hesitate to buy,4,Won’t stay charged!,3,5.0,2021,04,April,28
Love this mouse for ease and color :),8,"It's a pretty mouse! Just some notes.-Plastic a bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic. It's fine, just an aesthetic thing.- mouse wheel a bit noisy now after some use. squeeks and screetches some when scrolling.-battery life is fine. .glad i can use it when charging .- sensitivity is off. cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out. thought this was a battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes.Overall it's fine but I shouldve just bought something a bit sturdier even if it was pricier. gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth!",104,5.0,2021,04,April,28
Satisfied,1,"This so slim not comfortable for men with average size hand, maybe children can use it.Not sure how this things got 5 star reviews, I believe most 5 star reviews are made by paid promoters.",35,5.0,2021,04,April,28
Did not work,3,It works very good and the price is perfect.,9,1.0,2021,04,April,28
Nice look and feel.,4,"It has to be charged more than a normal one, but love it otherwise",14,4.0,2021,04,April,28
DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK.,7,The mouse is so fast and good!  Got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night. Easy set up,21,1.0,2021,04,April,27
Great mouse!,2,I got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it. Very easy to use and adorable,26,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Dies after 2 days of use,6,"I love this, no more batteries, and I love how it lights up...",13,1.0,2021,04,April,27
I like it,3,This mouse is garbage. Buyer beware. Doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't move the cursor. Bought 2 for 2 separate computers and its the same for both. Amazon basics mouse is 1000% better,32,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Only worked for 30 days,5,Lightweight. Easy bluetooth connection. The glow adds an extra pizzazz.😄,10,1.0,2021,04,April,27
Short life,2,"Worked great for about 1 week. Now won't work. Love the color and that it was a ""quiet click"" but disappointed that it died.",24,4.0,2021,04,April,27
Great buy,2,Product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well.,17,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Poor battery life,3,....not so great with the rendering. Dragging objects with the mouse is not so great. Especially acrosss screens. I work on visio a lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around. So basically has a bad sensor. But its smooth and very quiet.,48,2.0,2021,04,April,27
"Great mouse, inexpensive cost",4,I absolutely love my mouse. It's good quality and last a pretty long time before needing a charge.,18,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Great price for a rechargeable mouse!,6,"Not bad, rechargeable and portable. Highly recommend",7,5.0,2021,04,April,26
Do not waste your time,5,Don’t buy this! You have to charge it every day. You might as well have a mouse with a cord because that’s what it ends up being. It does not take a battery and Hass to be charged all the time.,41,1.0,2021,04,April,26
Too fragile,2,"Battery lasts forever, smooth and sleek design. If you use the middle mouse button, it's a little hard to click, but that's literally the only downside. Would recommend this mouse to anyone else looking for an affordable sleek mouse.",39,3.0,2021,04,April,26
Nice mouse,2,Nice and soft but the laser isn’t very accurate,9,5.0,2021,04,April,26
It's pretty,2,"Very light weight and low for click sounds. Long battery life,Easy to pair. Nice feeling of touch with my hand, I love to use this mouse for my WOT game on my laptop.",33,5.0,2021,01,January,25
Good deal,2,"The mouse worked immediately but stopped responding after 2 minutes. No troubleshooting worked, laptop recognized the dongle the whole time, but couldn't move the cursor or click. Tried on an additional computer and still no luck.",36,4.0,2021,04,April,26
blinky laser and poor performance,5,It is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud. RGB is decent for the price but I wish it was brighter. Overall its decent,31,1.0,2021,04,April,26
"Blue tooth enabled, quick to start, minimum power usage.",9,"I wanted a silent mouse due to classes using proctorio with a professor who was huge on thinking sounds could be cheating. I absolutely loved how silent it is when you press the buttons. Only thing I haven't got to work as well is the wireless aspect but it doesn't bother me, I just plug it in for charging wise and use it as a wired mouse. I love the changing lights as well, works well for my laptop. I loved having a light up gaming mouse for my desktop and now have something similar to use for my laptop that's quiet.",102,5.0,2021,04,April,25
I love tjis mouse!,4,I LOVE IT,3,5.0,2021,04,April,25
Great product,2,Had it five days and it would not recharge! Threw it away!,12,5.0,2021,04,April,25
Disappointed,1,Love this mouse. Love that I don't need to use batteries anymore. It's comfortable to use as well,18,1.0,2021,04,April,25
Very cheap!,2,Didn’t work piece of crap,5,1.0,2021,04,April,25
Turn it off when not in use or the battery will die,12,Nice looking mouse,3,4.0,2021,04,April,25
Cute but not that reliable,5,Easy to set up / connect....happy with this product,9,2.0,2021,04,April,25
Stopped working in less than a year,7,I wanted silent or soft clicks and that's what I got. The led light were a bonus for me.,19,2.0,2021,04,April,24
Good value,2,The mouse will not charge. And it feels cheaply made.,10,5.0,2021,04,April,24
Good value,2,Broken right after ran out of return window came . The narrow keep moving and linking event when is using or not using it. Don’t know what problem with it.,30,5.0,2021,04,April,24
Help attaching to macbook,4,"This mouse does what it needs for the most part. However, the cursor itself will jump all over the page from time to time which is annoying.",27,5.0,2021,04,April,22
works okay,2,"The one I'm currently using has been dropped a number of times, & is currently wrapped with scotch tape.  I wanted new one in the  event the older one gives up & quits on me.  And with this newer, sleeker one it has a splace for the USB connector to be stored (for travel purposes), on the underside of the mouse.  Another great feature, I think!",66,4.0,2021,04,April,21
Died after 10 months,4,"I love this mouse! I actually purchased two because of the look, but they are great! I use one at my home office and one at my office.",28,3.0,2021,04,April,21
it is cute everthing work on it and nothing is wrong with it i love it,16,"This mouse is rechargeable, which is great, except that it doesn't hold a charge. I charged it all night and the next day, it died after using it for 5 minutes. I would not recommend this item and will go back to a wireless mouse that uses batteries.",48,5.0,2021,04,April,21
Instructions,1,The battery life on this mouse is terrible.  It lasts maybe a day to a day and a half without recharging. Also a bit small and the grip is slippery.  I would not recommend it to anyone.,37,4.0,2021,04,April,21
long battery life,3,"I love the mouse, but sometimes it randomly stops working and my computer won’t recognize it. I noticed it did this when I used the changing color settings. I recommend just keeping it on “on” and not the changing colors setting.",41,5.0,2021,04,April,21
"Doesn’t work well, had to return",6,"Great product. Works as advertised, light and cool colors!!",9,1.0,2021,04,April,21
Good Mouse Excellent Price,4,It quit working after 2 weeks,6,5.0,2021,04,April,21
I'm satisfied!,2,It stopped working after jus 3 days. It Sucks period!!!,10,5.0,2021,04,April,21
NO REGRET,2,"It is okay. The scroll wheel and clicker are quiet, but the mouse emits a super high frequency noise any time it moves. I have become aware of it and can't stand using it much anymore.",36,5.0,2021,04,April,21
DOES NOT WORK,3,I bought this for my laptop for school work and it exceeded my expectations!!! The colors are amazing and not too distracting. So easy to connect and use. It’s also silent. I love it!,34,1.0,2021,04,April,21
LOVE the colors!  Super quiet!,5,"This mouse is great! It feels good in your handle, glides well, easy to use and looks amazing while doing it. It makes work a little less boring and looks so sleek on my desk.",35,5.0,2021,04,April,20
Love it!,2,Really like this mouse (never thought I’d say that..)It stores the USB port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces. It’s a quiet click which I appreciate even when working alone. And the rainbow lighting is optional.Win win win.It’s light too as it’s rechargeable! I carry it with my laptop and it’s made working on the go better,69,5.0,2021,04,April,20
It's cool,2,The mouse stopped working after about a month of use.,10,5.0,2021,04,April,20
Just okay,2,This is the best mouse and I love that it is rechargeable. I haven't had a lag problem unlike a mouse that requires batteries. I loved it so much I bought another ❤,33,3.0,2021,04,April,20
Quality not what I thought it would be,8,The item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did. I had to turn it off and then on again.And then after 3 days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely.,51,1.0,2021,04,April,20
"Nice lighting and easy to use, quiet",7,"Finally! The wireless, rechargeable mouse works as advertised. Small, handy, recharging is easy.",13,5.0,2021,04,April,20
"So far, so good!",4,Nice Mouse but I have had other rechargeable and this one seriously lacks uptime. I'm getting about a few days and dies quickly. My first one would last weeks but I lost it at a conference.... I should have went back to it...,43,5.0,2021,04,April,19
Awesome Product!,2,"It worked for 5min and then got stuck in my laptop, looks like made of cheap material",17,5.0,2021,04,April,19
Pretty,1,This product is useless and the quality is abysmal! I have never complained about any product I purchased from Amazon (or through Amazon) in the last 20 years as a customer. Please inform all your customers that this product is a cheap quality piece of damnation!,46,4.0,2021,04,April,19
"Charges via USB, great!",4,"Worked great for less than a month. Received in April 4 and broke today, May 2. No clue what happened. I went to use it after taking a break for a few hours and it just fell apart and I'm not able to put it back together.",47,5.0,2021,04,April,19
Good mouse with poor battery life,6,I wasn't sure what to expect with this mouse but it works perfectly. I never thought I'd be so excited to use a wireless mouse.,25,3.0,2021,04,April,18
Not very happy with the product,6,It works okay but is hard to charge.,8,3.0,2021,04,April,18
Works great. It's quiet and small form factor.,8,The metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop... talking about being sick,24,5.0,2021,04,April,18
How to immediately lose me as a potential buyer,9,"Honestly feels a bit on the cheap side, and compared to other similar makes, the main difference being LED lighting so it adds a 'wow' factor to it. Clicking is also smooth and feels nice, and the top-down view is pleasing. The lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than a seamless transition.Performance wise it does the job, but ergonomically doesn't feel as form-fitting as a gaming mouse. I'd really use this as a backup work mouse or a home mouse where its just to surf the web. Also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps. First time this has happened on a mouse, so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price.If I were to guess the price if I'd seen the product without a price tag, I'd probably say its about 6-7 bucks.",146,1.0,2021,04,April,18
Lag,1,This was a horrible purchase. I am returning this because it sucked.,12,2.0,2021,04,April,17
Don’t do it,3,"Developers really did-a-number with this device! This mouse speaks for itself. It is actually just what the marketing team indicated, AWESOME! I am a customizable type of consumer, thus I enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm. This led mouse Wowed-Me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage. Very well crafted and I look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress.",72,3.0,2021,04,April,17
Doesn't work well,3,"This is a great mouse. Quiet, responsive, fun color!",9,2.0,2021,04,April,17
"Ordered two, both dont work",5,"The main thing for me is that it is really pretty. Maybe that's just a girl reason to like it but I am a girl. And an artist. And maybe a wee bit eccentric. I want stuff around me to add to my environment, especially now. Other than that, well, its a mouse. It does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well. And its pretty!",71,2.0,2021,04,April,17
Go Ahead & Buy,4,"It’s cool, feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn’t last long.",15,5.0,2021,04,April,17
Love it,2,"The USB plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port. I can pull the USB out but the case stays inside the port. It's still useable if I put it back in though. It also has a very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves, especially when it's used close to the USB plug. It is not silent... that's for sure. I have to use music or headphones when I use this mouse or it drives me insane.It's shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand, but I have arthritis so I usually need a thicker/taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable. But I bought this mouse as a backup for my work laptop, so I don't use it as much as I use my gaming mouse.I like that you can still use it when it's plugged in to charge if you use a longer cable.",157,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Cute & light weight!,4,Love my pretty mouse!  It’s cooler than anyone else’s mouse!!!,10,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Terrible product,2,This is a great mouse. Easy to use runs very smoothly and the color matched my keyboard perfectly. I would recommend this product to anybody.,25,1.0,2021,04,April,16
It’s just not the right one for me,8,Battery last. Great for kid to use.,7,1.0,2021,04,April,16

Keeps a very good charge.,5,The slim design feels amazing. The price is perfect and the lights on it just make it fun.  Worth it!,20,5.0,2021,04,April,16
replaced,1,This is a fun mouse! Love the gold and the light show it provides. Most importantly it works so well and makes me work at light speed!,27,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Great mouse for the $ no doubt,7," Its an okay mouse. I disliked how ""cheap"" it appears because the rose gold color I got was a light spray on top and there are 3 distinct areas where the light is shining through.I'm also disappointed that when I turn the color changing led off but keep the mouse on that its a constant red color - which was not in the description.It also goes into sleep mode quickly and takes a good 15 seconds to reconnect which is frustrating.",81,5.0,2021,04,April,15
You get what you pay for,6,"I really like this mouse, it works very well and I do like the sleep mode for saving its charge. It’s only less desirable aspect is its cord. The connector at the mouse end does not slide smoothly into the connection.",41,2.0,2021,04,April,15
An Issue,2,Just all around terrible mouse,5,1.0,2021,04,April,15
Excellent,1,Love it. Slim line and fits in laptop bag much nicer than my old one and it's pretty!,18,5.0,2021,04,April,15
Mouse is worth the buy!,5,This is a good product.  It fits well in my hand and I love that it is rechargeable.  I would buy this mouse again.  I don't use it for gaming since that is something I don't do.  It serves my purpose well.,42,5.0,2021,04,April,15
excellent wireless mouse,3,Got this for my daughter and she loves it. It is rechargeable and lights up. She loves that it is so quiet when she is using it to play a game.,31,5.0,2021,04,April,15
Great buy!,2,"I knew it was too good to be true, this would be a great mouse but it just stopped working after a week. I have charged it a few times prior, no issues. I went to use it today and nothing. I would avoid and spend a few more bucks on something not as cheaply made.",56,5.0,2021,04,April,15
Good purchase!,2,Works great in laptop. Very aesthetically pleasing. Ready to use and install,12,5.0,2021,04,April,15
It’s a great mouse!,4,"Like others have reported, the mouse curser jumps around and blinks after a short (30 min) period of use making it difficult to control and sometimes nonresponsive. You have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision. I charged it over the weekend thinking the battery was not fully charged but the same results this morning. I have requested a refund and will be purchasing something that works.",72,5.0,2021,04,April,08
Wow!  Extremely Impressed!,3,Item came broken/ definitely looks used. I tried to charge and use still but scroll doesn’t work.,17,5.0,2021,01,January,25
Avoid this mouse,3,"This mouse arrived yesterday. I plugged it in for 2 hours, per the instructions, and then started to use it. It worked GREAT!Once I got off work, I turned it off and went about my merry way. When I returned and had to check on something, I tried to use it again and it is completely non-responsive. I've tried different USB ports, unplugging and replugging the dongle, and I even charged it overnight to ensure that it had a full charge.It does not work. I was so excited for this mouse. It's slim and quiet, which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that I do while still getting some work done on my vacations... but it's not worth the money. Less than 24 hours later and I'm back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn't going to work any longer.",148,1.0,2021,04,April,14
Very smooth and quiet,4,Will be returning middle track roller does not work. If the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection  with the computer and  you have to shut it off and turn it back on. The led color changer is cool other than that it's just ok.,48,5.0,2021,04,April,14
Returned,1,Didn’t buy this for gaming but it’s a smooth mouse which I love. I work from home and utilize this while on my work and home lap tops.,28,1.0,2021,04,April,14
Works great!,2,Love it very ergonomic,4,5.0,2021,04,April,14

Cool item,2,"Mine did not hold a charge very long.A day at the most, if I don't use it for work.When I used it for work, I needed to plug it in half through my workday. So I use it only on my private computer couple hours a day.",47,4.0,2021,04,April,13
Great for the Price,4,I really like my new LED Wireless mouse. It is easy to hold and it's really to look at. The LED lights change colors and it works great as a mouse. It adds some fun to your normal day. I love it!!,42,4.0,2021,04,April,13

Great mouse,2,"Grabbed this for my laptop so I don't have to mess with the trackpad for work. After 2 days of use, it no longer holds a charge. Not the fault of the charge port, as I switched it to a different one to be sure. The price is too good to be true!",53,5.0,2021,04,April,11

I ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome! Mouse is low profile with a really nice feel to it. I tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for Longevity.

Once I received it, I used it for approx half a day and then it died and never turned back on. I charged it through the pc for quite a while, when I realized it hadnt charged I tried a wall outlet.

What a waste,3,"It’s really cute and small. It fits well in my hands and feels nice. It worked well for about  a week. After that, it started having a lag.

Do not buy....,3,Stopped working shortly after I started using it,8,1.0,2021,04,April,02
good while it lasted,4,"I found this mouse to be too small for my hand and I'm not a large person by any means.  It might work for a child, but I found that my thumb kept blocking the left button.  Changing lighting was just distracting, although I might have become used to it if I could actually get the left mouse button to work.  It is also too flat for good ergonomics.  A hand at rest is normally more arched than this mouse allows.",81,1.0,2021,04,April,02
Love love love,3,"This mouse has a wonderful feel to it and the lights are pretty. However the first one broke not even five minutes into using it. It stopped being able to click. Second one lasted one day, the quit tracking. Pieces of junk. i am returning both.",46,5.0,2021,04,April,02

Very good mouse buy now,5,I have small hands and this fits perfectly.  Very cute and lightweight,12,5.0,2021,04,April,01
Obsessed,1, Sooo this thing is so cute for starters. It’s light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily. The buttons aren’t hard and actually it’s easier to click on different things.Only negatives I have. When it goes into sleep mode I have to turn it on and off.And the second thing is a pro and con for me. The usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse. I love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy. I just wish it had a latch release. I had to use a card to pop it out. Other than those 2 things it’s great! I didn’t even have to charge it when I took it out the box.,128,5.0,2021,04,April,01

Great product,2,It turns off when I’m using it sometimes,8,5.0,2021,03,March,31
Good mouse,2,Very chic and love the way it lights up. It has two settings either leave the lights totally on or have them cut on as you tap on the buttons. Works wonderful and I have only had to charge it one time since I've had the mouse.,47,5.0,2021,03,March,31
Light and easy,3,The first mouse did not work however I was sent a gift certificate for my trouble .  The other mouse (same model) works greatEasy to find because of the lights,30,5.0,2021,03,March,30

Very pleased,2,"The mouse was stunning when I first got it, it was very fluent but the one problem and a VERY major problem for me was the fact that the mouse kept left clicking every time I right clicked and my chromebook didn't have a setting to fix it.  Overall it was just an annoying issue.",55,5.0,2021,03,March,30
Terrible,1,"I like how easy it flow while using it, also how it lights up in different colors. Comfortable in my palm too.I would recommend",24,1.0,2021,03,March,30

Cute and performs well!,4,"There are two things I like about this wireless mouse: (1) it's rechargeable. It took me a while to get used to plugging it into my laptop when I'm not using it, but it's easy through the USB cable they provide and the charge lasts; and (2) while there is an on-off button, it's not so necessary as it goes into sleep mode when I close my laptop. All told, I am very satisfied with this mouse.",77,5.0,2021,03,March,28
Bargain for the product,4,Sleek and ergonomic to the touch!,6,4.0,2021,03,March,28
Good for lefty’s,3,I use this with my MacBook Pro and it works great! Very quiet and smooth.,15,5.0,2021,03,March,28
So pretty so worth it,5,While re-chargeable the battery life is terrible.  Feels cheap and does not track well.  Tossed in in the rubbish and purchased and Amazon Basics mouse.  Less expensive and far more capable alternative.,32,5.0,2021,03,March,28
Love it!,2,"I bought the gold. It's a soft brushed color and it's very quiet during use. The brightness of the color change is soft also. It fits comfortably in my palm, good purchase.",32,5.0,2021,03,March,27
Great buy,2,"It looks good, feels good, but just works poorly. Did not track smoothly at all, and more times than not I’m trying to get the pointer to stop having a little seizure on the screen. Tried with and without a pad under it.",43,4.0,2021,03,March,27
Dies quick,2,Works great! Comfortable and smooth.,5,2.0,2021,03,March,27
Slim and lightweight,3,I have had this mouse for about seven days and it is not track well if there’s a delay and it’s only broken the click button has already broken. My advice if you want something very sleek it’s a great sleek mouse but it’s not reliable. Don’t cheap out and get a better mouse.,54,5.0,2021,03,March,27
Dissapointed,1,"This mouse is awesome. It charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new Apple Mac plug thing. I hated my other Dell mouse and this one is so smooth, quick to react, and quiet!

Great Mouse,2,The mouse is very comfortable to use sturdy and fun with the LED light. Great Quality for the price,19,5.0,2021,03,March,27
10000% recommended,2,"I love this mouse! The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite. When I scroll forward (away from me) the page goes down and when I scroll backwards (towards me) the page goes up. I'm getting used to it, but I'd rather it just be like a normal mouse. Is there any way to fix this? Or does anyone else have this problem?",72,5.0,2021,03,March,26
Compatible with Microsoft surface pro,5,I love this mouse for the most part. The colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand. The only downside is that the right click has a tendency to stick even when I am only using the left click. I've had it for a few days now and that's the only negative.,54,5.0,2021,03,March,22
Nice,1,This mouse is great for what I use it for I like the RGB effects not really designed for gaming,20,5.0,2021,03,March,21
Don't Buy!,2, This mouse is lightweight.  It charges fast by a small cable which is included.  It does not take batteries. It puts on a light show of colors fun for adults or children.  This can easily be turned off by a switch on the bottom of the mouse.The mouse itself is easy to assemble.  There is a small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it.  This plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it.This is a great mouse to use as a backup.  The color is great also.Review title:  Great spare mouse,105,1.0,2021,03,March,26
Wireless mouse,2,"This is a very nice mouse for my needs. I like how it lights up, especially when I am using it in the dark, which makes it easier to use, and I appreciate that I do not have to buy batteries...worth the purchase.",43,5.0,2021,03,March,26
Basic,1,"For $11, this is the best wireless mouse I’ve ever used. Set it up in two minutes, feels good in my hand, the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent!

CORD IS FIRE HAZARD,4,"quit working, trashed it",4,1.0,2021,03,March,26
Great,1,The mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat. Super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly! but you better not drop it or drop anything you're carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every 2 minutes you use it there after. I should have expected this from such a cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous.,68,5.0,2021,03,March,25

Just Perfect,2,"This is so pretty! Fits I'm my hand perfect, the lights are soooo pretty lol it was beyond easy to set up on my laptop. It came partially charged even. So I could use right out the box. Easy to charge. Lasts really long time too. Love it, would totally gift!!!",51,5.0,2021,03,March,24

All what you need in a mouse,7,Great Product 100% recommended!,4,5.0,2021,03,March,23
Much Better Than You Would Expect,6,"The mouse is contained in a Japanese package but was made in China. It comes with the type-c adapter, c-charging/usb cable, regular 2.0 USB mouse receiver, and thin instructions.I've plugged the Type C adapter into two different machines with the same result. Neither laptops read the type c directly or through another adapter. I've also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type c with the same results. None of them work through this adapter.Other than that issue the mouse works. It also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again. The also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included. Just plug in the charging cord into an empty USB slot.The color changing around the rim of the mouse gives a nice touch, and although at first the mouse feels 'long' due to it's sleek shape, it does fit comfortably in the hand. It also has a plastic-like feeling, and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn't malfunction or break.",178,5.0,2021,03,March,23
Great value for money,4,Very sleek looking. As pictured. I love the color. Good product,11,5.0,2021,03,March,23

Mouse,1,It matches my computer,4,5.0,2021,03,March,22
Great value,2,This mouse has been so much better on my wrists.  It’s sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist. I love the rechargeable aspect because I no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements. It is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away. So many colors to choose from too!,76,4.0,2021,03,March,22
Does not hold charge very long,6,"The rose gold color is very pretty, and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch - the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors. There is an option to turn the colors off, but you end up with a red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around. It will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to a Logitech or name brand. Get what you pay for in this case.",97,3.0,2021,03,March,22
"Great little mouse, very light but solid",7, I Like the color. I thought it was going to have changing colored lights. It only close red which was disappointing. It’s also kind of flat and smaller than I expected. Overall I mean does what I need it to do.,41,5.0,2021,03,March,22
Good quality product.,3,"i recently bought a new chromebook and wanted a wireless mouse to match, i came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it a try, i cant say how good it works yet because i never recieved the usb-c adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well. otherwise its slim which is what i wanted and i like the lights on it",89,4.0,2021,03,March,22
Not worth your dime,4,"This mouse has a very poor sensor. It will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for a bit, and you sometimes have to click the DPI button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up. The sensor also cannot move fast. If I try moving the mouse quickly, the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like Deja Vu is playing in the background.Speaking of clicks, the left mouse button double clicks quite a bit.The only thing this mouse has going for it is its design. Even then, the design is uncomfortable since its so flat.Find a better mouse. Please. Don't torture yourself with this.",117,2.0,2021,03,March,21
Love,1, Works very well. I keep the led light shut off to save battery. I've had it for about a week and haven't needed to charge it yet. I shut it off when not in use. It's so nice not to have a cord to deal with. I want to buy another one I love it so much! The color is gorgeous 😍,62,5.0,2021,03,March,21

Just say no.,3,"Every time I use the mouse, there is this high-pitched noise! Hurts my ears",14,1.0,2021,03,March,20
Colorful mouse excellent buy,4,"I purchased 2 for our office.  The mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty, but mine started having problems just a few days later.  It was unresponsive and jerky for a few days.  Then it stopped working (despite charging overnight).  I tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn't bad, but it wouldn't hold a charge and died again within minutes.  When I asked the other employee about his identical mouse (different color) he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn't hold a charge.  I used the included cord and tried charging with the computer, with a hub, with a power strip, and with a charging block (not included) plugged into multiple outlets.When returning, I packaged the items as requested and requested the pick-up slip.  We found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office a few days later- not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door.  No one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn't have found it if a staff member hadn't gone out to sanitize the outside door handles.  Now we have to take it to a drop off location because a return pickup is going to cost $7 (despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off).  I am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller.",252,5.0,2021,03,March,20
Great,1,"This light up mouse is great, and I've had a few similar ones. I like that this one is rounded on the edges (more aesthetically pleasing, imo).It holds a charge for long enough that it's not annoying, though It would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more. The options are just ""on"" (constant red light) or ""*"" (cycles through colors). Clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get.The only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only 3 weeks of use. I intend to drop some WD40 onto it and I'm sure that will fix the problem, but I don't think that should be necessary to begin with.Overall a good choice, though!IMMEDIATE UPDATE: Directing WD40 into the ""wheel well"" of the mouse is not easy, even using a pin. Dropped the mouse, and now the wheel doesn't scroll at all, it just spins. Soooooo not great. Removing a star. Either a) accept the squeaky wheel or b) be VERY careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die. UGH",195,4.0,2021,03,March,19
Great choice!,2,"Idk if I would say this is a great mouse for gaming but, it’s great for the price and very smooth. Different setting are great too. Flip the lights on and it’s like a rave in your hand!",38,5.0,2021,03,March,19

Does not last,3,"Decent little wireless mouse, priced good for children who tend to lose and destroy things. Biggest issue is the charging cable that comes with it is garbage. Can be charged using a phone charger. All in all a decent purchase and would buy again!",44,1.0,2021,03,March,16

I really loved it .... but...,6,"Just got this last night for my new ACER, when I plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around (with usb or usb C plug).  It zig-zags across the screen when trying to move in a straight line.  It stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision.  I charged it overnight and same results this morning, I adjusted the DPI with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen. I tried troubleshooting but I can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so I will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works.",120,3.0,2021,03,March,16

Stopped working within a month...,5,"I like the mouse. Originally, I thought it wast great for the price and I’m glad to be wrong. The mouse is a little sensitive because I dropped it once causing it to freeze somewhat. However, after re-installing it, it seemed to fix the issue.

Good,1,Super cute mouse. I love the color and I love the LED lights. My only issue is that it's very glitchy. Like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn't good. I sit at a desk for 8 hours and it's a completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own.,57,3.0,2021,03,March,11
Compatible with MacBook Pro?,4,Very quite clicking.,3,4.0,2021,03,March,11
Works perfectly,2,I love the option to turn off the lights. It is nice that its rechargeable and can be used while charging if needed. The color I got was a mint color (I do not recall what it was listed as). It is a fun color and the light on the mouse are an added bonus.,55,5.0,2021,03,March,11

Charge doesn't last long enough,5,"Since I mainly draw art, I didn't see a need to have a bulky gaming mouse. This fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when I'm drawing at night while the family is asleep. The ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me. I enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option! It's a good buy for a casual office or laid back working experience.",96,2.0,2021,03,March,10

Double check before you buy it,6,My order came fast and on time. I use this little mouse at work all the time. It is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel. Easy to clean.

Seems to work once you figure it out.,8,Its cool.,2,4.0,2021,01,January,30
Comfortable,1,"I like the design and feel of the mouse.  My concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime I have not used it for a few minutes, I have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on.  I guess with time I will learn to do that each time I want to use it.  In use, it does not function as smoothly as I had hoped it would, hesitating to start and then the curser ""hops"" when I am trying to drag it from one place to another.",97,5.0,2021,03,March,08

Like it,2,"I bought this mouse, because I saw it was a wireless ""silent"" click. Which was perfect for me working in a class room and not loving to hear the click of a mouse all day. I have dropped it 3 + times and each time I have been able to just move the plastic back into place and ""repair"" so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when I move between classes to see my different classes.",77,5.0,2021,02,February,10

Awesome!,1,"Love this new mouse! I work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday. I was originally using a big bulky gaming mouse ( it lights up and looked cool) for the last 2 years, but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter. I saw this and had to see what it was about. Let me tell you I LOVE this new mouse. Its so small and light and easy to use. The clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand. Yes it is plastic but it actually doesn't feel cheap and feels like a good build. It's very responsive and glides very smooth. The only gripe is to wake of up from Sleep you have to click the mouse button, instead of just moving it like most items, but that's a very minor issue. Oh, and the different colors it comes In is nice. Also, the RGB color changing lighting is a very nice effect. I definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use.",184,5.0,2021,02,February,09

"This thing is wonderful, you got to try one",9,Not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again. I thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold. I thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife.

Update: squeals and dies quickly!,5,"I love the way the mouse looks and feels, but oh the mistakes I make! This mouse has a mind of it's own and jumps all over the place. I have accidentally closed files/programs while working on them, move public folder (and having to contact IT to move back), and many more random errors as a result of this erratic mouse. Sometimes, while not even using the mouse - I can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen. Perhaps there is a ghost in the machine, but if so, they are hostile... I will be replacing it ASAP!",101,1.0,2021,02,February,05
Love it,2," I wish I would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before I purchased the white one.I don't like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse. I assumed it would just be a line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures. If you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you.Overall, I do like the mouse and don't want to deal with exchanging. I planned on getting the mint and I should have gone with my instincts. It glides smoothly and the clicks are slient. I won't be returning it because I do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown/described",131,5.0,2021,02,February,05

Love this device.... highly recommend !!!,6,"A rechargeable cordless mouse is such a good idea and invention. You don't have to deal with batteries.  And this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over a day.. Great!!This one I bought worked well even though it did something odd,  (and I am not sure if it was the mouse or the ""inexpensive"" tablet computers that I use,  or maybe the USB splitters that I use, however it was probably the mouse ) but  after using the mouse normally for a few hours,  the mouse  would then  not show the arrow on the screen and I found that I would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again. It was  as if  I had to re-boot the mouse periodically.  It seemed to have  nothing to do with recharging. This would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged.  It would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was  a minor flaw.But then one day, ( actually the date of this writing March 16 2021)  I put the mouse receiver into a different receptacle to use a different tablet computer  and it would not work no matter what I tried to do.  Then I decided to take out the receiver from the USB receptacle  and found that the metal, square part on the receiver stuck into the USB receptacle.  So this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver  became faulty with regular use over  a few weeks  since I bought it.  Otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way. Not rugged enough maybe.However though I don't know  at this point  if this is the way that  ALL these rechargeable mouses are  (this brand)  or if this particular one that I bought  just did not actually pass quality control at the factory,  it seems the company should give me a replacement.I am going to see about it but I guess  I will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached.I will update if I am able to.",352,5.0,2021,02,February,04

Beware metal casing stuck inside your USB port,8,"This mouse is great, and if it didn't do this one annoying thing I would give it 5 stars. It emits a really high pitched squeal when you don't use a mousepad. It coincides with the LED light color change, if you pick it up and set it down, it makes a really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in a quiet environment, which I do. It's similar to a smoke alarm if it were far away. Get one that doesn't have the lights, that should help.",91,3.0,2021,02,February,03
Not impressed so far,4,"The only thing I do not like is having to charge it with a usb.  Sometimes I’m trying to use it and it’s dead, so I connect to computer and I can use it.  Works best with longer cord that I don’t have.",43,3.0,2021,02,February,03
Good buy,2,"I HAD THE MOUSE CHARGING ALL WEEKEND. WHEN I RETURNED TO WORK MONDAY MORNING, I SMELLED SOMETHING HOT, BUT NO ONE ELSE SMELLED ANYTHING. I WENT TO UNPLUG MY MOUSE AND MY CORD WAS SO HOT I COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT. THE ENTIRE CORD MELTED AND THE WIRES HAD BURNED THROUGH THE RUBBER COATING. VERY EASILY COULD HAVE CAUGHT MY COMPUTER ON FIRE. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE UNLESS YOU HAVE GREAT FIRE INSURANCE!",74,5.0,2021,02,February,03

Stopped working,2,I thought this mouse was gonna work really good and  last a long time based on the reviews. Unfortunately the charger that came with the mouse isn't charging the mouse.

"Slim, silent and comfortabe.",4,"Simply put, it is a great mouse for what it's worth. However, I had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the USB c adapter that comes with the product. I have 4 ports. The manual (grammar is terrible btw) tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them.. NONE OF THEM WORKED which was a bummer.. then I tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away! The adapter they provide you is just useless. So if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook, you should get a separate adapter. Once I connected it though, it seemed to work perfectly..smooth tracking, silent clicks and the RGB lighting is beautiful. I just got it today so hopefully, it will keep working the way they claim it should work.",144,5.0,2021,01,January,31
Not bad for the price.,5,The wireless feature and recharging from computer.,7,3.0,2021,01,January,31
Great Product,2,"Just go to your local department store. When I opened the package and inspected the mouse, it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom. It works and gets the job done. I bought this mouse because I was tired of buying batteries for another wireless mouse. The mouse will not work when you have it plugged into the computer to charge.",67,5.0,2021,01,January,30

Almost perfect,2,"Seemed to work okay for the minute I used the mouse for my security camera nvr system BUT it had scratches around both sides.

Amazing,1,Good mouse for regular use. Great rgb lighting,8,5.0,2021,01,January,29
DISAPOINTED,1,Super easy to use. Just plug in to do the initial charge and then recharge via the USB cord as needed. Kinda fun to have the light display change colors throughout the day. Soft touch when you right or left click and barely makes any clicking noise.,47,2.0,2021,01,January,29

works great,2,"Just ordered this as a nice wireless mouse for my Surface Pro. It works nice but when I went to pull the USB out of the Surface pro, part of it stayed stuck in the port.  I had to use pliers to pull it out. Not sure if this just a tight fit or poor workmanship.  Other than that the Mouse works fine.",63,5.0,2021,01,January,29

I'm happy with it so far,6,"I don't normally like using a mouse when I am on my laptop, but they built in keys on my laptop were starting to go so I decided to purchase a mouse. When looking for a mouse, I wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back. It fits my hand perfectly and I enjoy how sleek it looks. The only thing that I would change is being able to decide the color(s) and color patterns. Other than that, it was worth the purchase.",88,5.0,2021,01,January,29
Cool mouse,2,Product stopped working shortly after a month. Wouldn’t click properly.,10,5.0,2021,01,January,29
Fast,1,I love this mouse but hate it at the same time. I love it because it’s cute and it functions well.....that is if it doesn’t run out of battery charge. During normal use the charge only lasts for about 3 days. It’s good that it can be recharged I just didn’t think I would be recharging it that often. You can tell when it’s running low because it starts jumping all over the place. I just try to remember to charge it while I’m charging my laptop. Also I was under the impression that it came as a usbc to charge and it does not. It comes with an adapter for usb to usbc. I could’ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear.,129,5.0,2021,01,January,29

Stopped working in week,4,"Sensor doesn’t always pick up movements. To clarify, I am not using this f gaming but as a wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate. Sometimes when I sit for too long, the sensor takes time to come back online Andreas movements. This can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from a $13 mouse.Overall, I’d you are doing menial office tasks, this is probably an okay mouse. The rechargeable batter is cool and I am happy to not have to replace batteries but I would probably go with a wired mouse in the future.",113,1.0,2021,01,January,29

Awesome little mouse!,3,"The click isn't loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder. The battery doesn't last near long enough, not even a whole day, even when you don't have the lights on.

Love this mouse!,3,I never write reviews. As a matter of fact this is the first I have ever written but due to the danger factor I felt compelled to.My son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within a minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames- yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire.,69,5.0,2021,01,January,27

"Liking the lighted aspect, and no batteries.",7,I got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it. Well day 1 it wouldn’t charge. So i gave it a break and decided to try charging it on my Mac (she had originally tried w/ her school chrome book). Few seconds of it being plugged in & it started SMOKING. It smelled like burning plastic so I quickly just unplugged and didn’t bother doing anything else with the mouse.,77,5.0,2021,01,January,27
Stylish,1,"Great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic. Perfect for the bag that has just enough space. When you’re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly, it’s sleep mode feature is a nice adage, increasing battery life and usability. As far as gaming goes, I would recommend only lite/casual games only, not for gaming on the heavy side. Overall 9/10 would buy again",71,5.0,2021,01,January,27

Very good mouse!,3,"I was looking for a wireless rechargeable mouse because I recently lost my old mouse but I’m kind of glad I did because I really love this one! It’s super cute, sleek and the lights are so pretty. The clicks are quiet like it says in the description and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a mouse.",62,5.0,2021,01,January,23
Perfect for Us!,3,"This mouse is sleek, slim, and so pretty! I love the lights! The battery goes pretty quick when using the light changing setting, but has a lower setting it lasts quite a while. Would definitely recommend it!",37,5.0,2021,01,January,22
doesn't light up rainbow,4,"I like this mouse.  The light colors constantly scroll through a rainbow and aren't static on just one color.  My office is in my bedroom, and if I leave the mouse on, it makes a great nightlight -- not too bright, but just light enough to find my way around if I wake up during the night.  I especially love the fact that it's rechargeable and that I haven't had to put any batteries in it since I bought it several months ago.The thing I don't like is that it has a tendency to do its own thing sometimes.  If I'm working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me (flat and completely still, not rolling backwards or moving at all) the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at a diagonal, stuttering its way up and across the screen.  At other times, I will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw a line and the cursor will suddenly jump to a completely different part of the screen, or it will ""hiccup"" and lose the hold on what I was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble (sometimes quite sharply, kind of like trying to draw a straight line in the car when the tire hits a pothole).It's a good little mouse, and aside from the spastic glitches, I'm pleased with it, but I am getting tired of not having full control right when I need it most.  I may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer.",268,1.0,2021,01,January,22
It's easy-to-use,2,It does not work and I have tried to reach the seller. Instructions in chinese and simply poor poor service. Purchase at own peril. great disappointment for my kid.,29,5.0,2021,01,January,22

Nice mouse,2,"My daughter needed a wireless mouse for her laptop. I came across this one and bought it for it's cool features, size, and price.

Cool mouse,2,"I really like how sleek this mouse is, it extremely functional and the lights add a cool “futuristic” type of vibe making my experience enjoyable every time. Another neat function is the silent clicker, I work early mornings so to not wake up my family with the constant clicking of a noisy mouse is definitely a luxury.

"Don’t bother, it’s not worth the irritation...",7,"The mouse is a colorful addition to my desk and, unlike other computer mice I have owned, it does NOT have thumb-operated controls on its left side, where a left-handed person like myself would unintentionally press a button and start a function they didn't want to activate.  I've only had it for about a week, so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged; the light display draws a significant amount of power, so I need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever I shut down the PC.",93,3.0,2021,01,January,21
DONT BUY,2,Love it,2,1.0,2021,01,January,21
Doesn’t sleep,2," The black feels super soft. I just plugged it into my USB-C on my computer. It also comes with a USB adapter Incase you don’t have that. Left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly. Middle scroll works great, the click is a bit louder and it won’t click onto a document so that click that doesn’t do anything. Happy with this purchase, it looks great at night and it’s such a gamer / music producer look.",77,1.0,2021,01,January,21

Squeaky Mouse,2,Purchased as a gift for my nephew. He really likes it.,11,3.0,2021,01,January,20
Warning this product may have been tampered with,8,"3 month update: This thing squeals now! It took me a week to figure out why I kept hearing a high pitched whine every time I moved my cursor, and eventually I realized that something inside the mouse is creating a very high pitched squeal every time I move it -- that, on top of the mouse dying in about a day of use now, means that this thing is a no-go. Definitely buy something else, this thing has been a total headache since I got it.The battery on this mouse doesn't seem to last a very long time, after about two days of usage it'll die. I find myself plugging it in every night to make sure I don't have to deal with that.Additionally, the thing goes to sleep after about a minute or two without movement -- super annoying, you have to click the mouse to wake it up again, and doing so registers a click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep. Can't recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading, you'll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about a million times.",201,1.0,2021,01,January,20
Great Customer Service From Shop Over Unique Product,8,My mouse decided to stop working and forced me to have to get a new one. I found this one and thought I would give it a try.

Bluetooth Mouse,2,The metal casing for the USB remote came  off and is now stuck  in the USB port of my computer,20,5.0,2021,01,January,19
love it,2,"First, the left mouse click is not sensitive enough, requiring a longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click. Annoying, and I'm betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder/longer. Another less significant annoyance: make sure you don't turn on the light feature. It looks cool, but the thing acts like a lava light night light, continually changing colors of light even when not in use (even with the computer off), which will run down the battery. I like the rechargeable feature, but I will be looking for another mouse.",100,5.0,2021,01,January,19
The charger,2,The mouse is sleek and comfortable. I enjoy the sleep mode because I am terrible about turning off my mouse when I'm not using. Setup is simple since it has an adapter.,32,4.0,2021,01,January,19

Disappointing,1,"I love this mouse , I've had others before  but never like this , it was so easy to connect,  just  plug in the USB connector and thats it , no drivers to install  or to download  , works  right out the box .. its so natural  when using  this mouse  , I even used it when I was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest , I would  recommend this all day , good product..",80,2.0,2021,01,January,18
Rechargeable mouse,2, I was in the market for a new mouse as my Logitech wireless was going bad on me. I was red to stay wireless and had a budget. The Logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when I wanted one that looked cool. And the cheaper ones were too normal looking. I got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were a cool feature. I got it and it feels great. It feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn’t have the typical mouse click sound.Edit: I had to get a other mouse as my first broke. It was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident. Since it was so cheap I just bought another and it works as well as the first.,139,5.0,2021,01,January,18

So far so good,4,"I'm not rating this one star because it is a cute mouse and I like the design. For some reason, I found my MacBook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse. My wrists were hurt within a couple hours of using this mouse. That being said, I used it in moderation. I wanted to like it. However, I received this mouse January 4th. As of January 31, responsiveness has gone downhill. After taking it off the charger (it has a short battery life), it takes about 30 seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again.

it's such a eye catcher.,5,"For $10, you are better off getting a wired mouse. This thing is so bad, the sensor light bleeds through the top  shell of the mouse. Worse is that the actual functionality is very poor, if your are looking for an accurate mouse, this is not it. I have a multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use. If you have a plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable, but if your on the go, this will not do.",91,5.0,2021,01,January,16
Daughter loves it,3,"Highly recommend, silent click is great. You have the option to turn off the color changing mode.",17,5.0,2021,01,January,15
The most quiet wireless mouse,5,Would recommend and would buy again.,6,5.0,2021,01,January,15
"slim wireless mouse, rosetone",4,"Easy to setup, just plug in the USB and it works. Smooth cursor movement and clicking, but the wheel does not scroll very well. Only moves the screen a few lines and then it quits scrolling all together.",38,1.0,2021,01,January,15
It’s ok,2,"Great so far, I use it for my MacBook Pro and I'm really enjoying it. Great touch and super lightweight.",20,5.0,2021,01,January,15
I guess you get what you pay for.,8,Super quiet! You just don't hear any clicks.  Love that it is rechargeable instead of replacing batteries. I have had it for weeks and I have only charged it twice.,30,2.0,2021,01,January,15
"This mouse is okay, bordering on pretty good",8,Great mouse,2,4.0,2021,01,January,15
Sweet addition to my work/comfort place,6,"I really enjoy the feel of the mouse, it's slick which has put less strain on my wrist but I'll still be getting a wrist support. The colors don't need to be turned on and when left in middle, it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath.",51,5.0,2021,01,January,14
Great gaming mouse!,3,"Could use an instruction sheet.  Also, what is the expected battery life on a single charge.”?",16,5.0,2021,01,January,14
Nice Mouse; as advertised.,4,I love the color and the light the most. It’s so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers.,24,5.0,2021,01,January,14
Product Update,2,"I am old school when it comes to navigating the screen.  I work much faster with a wireless mouse.  Everything about this mouse is great EXCEPT you gotta to charge it.  Mouse that require batteries work for a very long time. Months in fact.  The charge on this mouse doesn't last long.  I have to remember to turn it off when I'm not using it.  I also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use.  Starts acting sluggish as power runs down.  My old mouse is 15 years old.  I wanted a cool new one to match my new laptop.  This one has a soft smooth click.  The LED lights are really fun.  However, I threw away the box before I tried it out.  I would send it back if I had kept shipping material.  I'll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging.  So much for progress.i",155,5.0,2021,01,January,14
Disappointed,1,I made sure that this product was gonna be a good one and i was not disapointed. It's silent click which is nice. The lights look awesome on it. It was just worth it.,34,2.0,2021,01,January,13

Had to return,3,"UPDATE: I have upped my review from 2 to 3 since I reached out to the seller and they offered to send a replacement USB dongle. Will update the review again once that has been received. **I would have given this mouse five stars a month ago, but yesterday when I removed the USB dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless. I tried to piece it back together but it won't stay together. It's a shame because this mouse is really cool looking, feels nice in my hand, and holds a charge a long time. Very disappointed!",107,1.0,2021,01,January,13
Good buy,2,"This is a very user friendly modle.  Very light weight, silent, rechargable, and easy to move around.  Just one suggestion, it will be better if the instruction has English version.",30,5.0,2021,01,January,13

Perfect,1,Soo cute!!! Very sleek design.  I love that it came with the Type C attachment.  I have a new laptop that doesn't have USB ports.  Oh yea!! The rose gold color matches my laptop perfectly!!! The color changing lights around thw mouse are to die for.... very cool feature,49,5.0,2021,01,January,11

"USB DID NOT FIT ADAPTER & ARRIVED WITH SCRATCHES - Ordered twice, second mice didn't work.",16,"Is almost tiny for my hands and very light. Works so good and decently priced I'll learn to use it for surfing the web. Yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side, but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to. Many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle I think I'm holding it.  In the past I've had taller models that have a flair formed to keep the fingers in position. In construction using stuff that requires a good grip, makes this like using a feather I barely feel. Makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make a lot fast moves. Elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good, I may even make a flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down. It is cool with the lights no joke,  a good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control, lol, yet thank you, I found another fun product on Amazon again.",210,1.0,2021,01,January,09
Lasted 5 days!,3,"I purchased this mouse for my chromebook which only has a mousepad. I enjoy that it really lights up. It is lightweight and an easy glide finish. It's wireless and rechargable. The wireless adapter fits in the bottom of the mouse. So, you don't lose it.",46,1.0,2021,01,January,09

"Pretty mouse, does the job!",5,love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since i got it amazing,15,4.0,2021,01,January,09
Installation instructions are confusing.,4,Wish you could select the color of the rgb light. It just cycles through all of them. Nothing in the instructions so it must only cycle. Besides that it’s nice. Super quiet click. Clicking the scroll wheel is loud and hard though.,42,3.0,2021,01,January,09
"Wish this mouse kept the charge, SO SAD . . .",11,"The right click button stopped working within a few weeks.  Troubleshot by reboot , control panel settings, and even  recharge overnight.  No luck.",23,1.0,2021,01,January,09

meh,1,"I have many wireless mouses (mice?) trying to find the right one for my home office/studio.  I bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish.  It arrived and I have never used a mouse that's this quiet before, it's insane.  It feels great when I use it, it's smooth and very ergonomic.  This was definitely worth the price, and I may replace my other wireless devices with this model!",73,3.0,2021,01,January,08

Poorly made,2,It's cheap. My right click requires more Force than my left. The LEDs aren't that vibrant. Not ergonomic. It's a decent mouse but I wouldn't recommend it for gaming.,29,1.0,2021,01,January,08
Mouse,1,"The calibration on this is terrible. I can’t even use it. It goes all over the place, doesn’t go where im directing it to go. I make calls for work on my computer and it’s hung up when I was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen. It’s terrible.",51,5.0,2021,01,January,08
Very nice mouse,3,The battery life on it is crap. You have to recharge it every few hours. It’s not worth the hassle. When it’s charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn’t move the cursor the way you move the mouse.,42,5.0,2021,01,January,07
Good find!,2,Granddaughter likes the lights,4,4.0,2021,01,January,07
Awesome Mouse,2,you get about 8 hours use time on this and then you have to charge it up separately. Not worth the trouble.,22,5.0,2021,01,January,07
IT sucks,2,"The mouse lasts a good while on a charge, as it shuts itself off.A good product.",16,1.0,2021,01,January,07

I love that it is a quiet mouse no click noise.,11,"It doesn't have a tail, so it's more of a hamster, but it is a very nice hamster! It lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor. I can't speak on it for gaming as I only use it for working from home, but I did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well. Obviously, 10/10, did indeed by it again!",70,5.0,2021,01,January,06

Rechargeable,1,Don’t bother doesn’t work,4,5.0,2021,01,January,05
Amazing,1,So I really like it. I like you can shut of the lights if you want.  It is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it's very easy for a person who has a laptop.,36,5.0,2021,01,January,04
does not charge,3,Second one. Same issue.  The mouse wheel just stops working.  Do not order this product learn from my mistakes.,19,1.0,2022,09,September,10

Cheap and reliable,3,"This is a great little mouse. It is small, responsive and I love the way the light changes colors. My hand is more relaxed when I'm using it than with my previous mouse. I have had no issues with it so far. Overall, based upon my experience thus far, this was a good purchase and I would buy it again.",60,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Great wireless mouse,3,"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. So in all the charging feature does not work. :( It was a cute mouse though, but it doesn't work.",40,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Great wireless mouse,3,"I did not like that it made a very faint squealing noise. The colors are pretty and the clicks are quiet. But everytime the mouse moves, you can hair a high pitch noise. The instructions were all in a foreign language as well",43,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Lightweight and rechargeable,3," UPDATE to prior review: This mouse started out great, was so excited about it at first. Then after a couple months in, all of the sudden, the usb that goes into the computer just snaps/breaks. And, I'll add I did nothing to it. One day while working from home I moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn't functioning. I looked to see why, then saw the usb had just cratered into a couple pieces. So now I paid $16 for nothing! Good Lord my own money too, not something my office will reimburse me for either. Nice work.",102,5.0,2021,01,January,04
not what i expected,4,"Clicking this mouse takes so much force I have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it. And if I ever pick the mouse up off the pad, my cursor moves erratically around, even if it's pointed at the ceiling.Literally the 2 most important things for a mouse: pointing and clicking, are useless on this thing.Looks nice, though.",62,2.0,2021,01,January,03
Nice mouse,2,"On my laptop, it skips/doesn’t read about 10% of the time, making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time. I tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces, and it does the same no matter what.",44,5.0,2021,01,January,03

A meh mouse,3,"Not a fan. Wouldn’t sync with one computer. Worked great with the other computer, but it didn’t “sleep” when I was done with it. So the next day, the battery was dead. I’ll never remember to turn off the mouse when I’m not using it, so this is not going to be very useful.",54,3.0,2021,01,January,02
Great,1,"Works great, just feels a little flimsy so I'm not sure how it will hold up.  I suppose it's a good value for the price.  The slowly changing colored LED lights are pretty cool.  I like that, unlike the Apple Magic Mouse, you can use this mouse while it is charging. The seller extended the warranty another 6 months after I registered it, so that gives me a little more confidence in the quality (or at least the customer service).I was compensated by the seller for this review with a refund of the purchase price of the mouse.",98,5.0,2021,01,January,02

slim wireless mouse,3,"I originally ordered the white version but when I got it, I realized it was see-through. I asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version I ordered or what all the white mouses look like. They’re all white, according to the shop. Because I raised concern, they were so kind to ship a different color to me free of charge. I didn’t even have to return the original!",73,5.0,2020,12,December,31
Great mouse for everyday use,5,This mouse works excellent. It’s easy to move. Very lightweight. I love the way it lights up. Excellent buy.,19,5.0,2020,12,December,31
Good price,2,It works great. Fits my hand great. Only thing is the lights don’t work at efficiently. Happy with the product overall.,21,4.0,2020,12,December,31
Great mouse for the price.,5,If you need a mouse just for making your life easier while working with spread sheets or any other microsoft office tool this is perfect. I'm not quite sure how comfortable this would be for gaming though.,37,5.0,2020,12,December,31

Super cute!,2,I really liked everything about this product!!,7,5.0,2020,12,December,30
Not multi colored,3,it's easy to use and works well there is no loud clicking when using it. to get it to change colors you must push the on button all the way up to the top. and it changes color when you touch it which I find pretty cool,47,2.0,2020,12,December,30
Comfortable mouse,2,This came with an c3 charging attachment but why? This uses a normal cell phone charger port. And all the intuitions are in Chinese. Theres a random button at the top and when I press it Nothing happens. And I dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it. Other than that I really like it so far. Its very sleek.,64,5.0,2020,12,December,30
Very nice mouse!,3,This mouse is very sleek and comfortable to use. The click is very quiet. I highly recommend for the price!,20,5.0,2020,12,December,29
"Read if you want, beats me",6,The LED lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well. I am disappointed and would not buy it again.,29,3.0,2020,12,December,29
Comfortable - No Sleep mode,5,The wheel button feels like it requires 5x the force to activate and makes 10x the noise of the other 2 buttons. Whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun. The wheel button gets more use in CAD software than any other button and not even 5 minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where I can not continue to work.,68,4.0,2020,11,November,19
Love these!,2,"I was skeptical at first that such a small ergonomic mouse would work, I’m pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it. I forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other. I got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged. I highly recommend this Mouse and plan on buying another to have as a backup for when I forget to charge. I really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun.",104,5.0,2020,12,December,29
Great quality! Vibrant colors!,4,I use this with my macbook pro and its a good eye catcher when I'm djing.,16,5.0,2020,12,December,28
Very very thin,3,"This mouse is very quiet, just as advertised.  I was shocked at the lack of ""clicking"" when you push the right or left side.  That was my main push to purchase, besides the cool colors and LED lights.  I must say those are just an aestetic  bonus, but it kind of makes working fun.  This mouse is plastic, so the ""gold"" tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic.  It charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse.  Overall, this mouse is really great.  I am glad I bought it and if you are sitting on the fence, just go ahead and get it.",115,4.0,2020,12,December,27

Update: Customer service contacted me and they will send me a new product.,13,The mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition. The pairing was fast and easy. I spent $100.00 on a razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months! I'm very happy with my purchase.,42,4.0,2020,12,December,26

Lights up nice,3,Works great! And looks classy!,5,5.0,2020,12,December,24
Need to push really hard to click,7,"It's cute I guess. It is pretty cheaply made. You can just tell by the feel of it. I got the matte black one. It charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge. I love the nano USB plug. It came with a cord, but I just use my phone charger. It does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom. The instructions are all in Chinese, but using it is pretty easy. The nano fits in a little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter. It is quite flat, so not the best for long term use like with gaming. I'll keep it, but wouldn't purchase it again for the price.Update:I have used this cheap little mouse for HOURS every night since I got it. I've only had to charge it maybe once a week. The charge is phenomenal. Still works perfectly!!",161,2.0,2020,12,December,24
Ergonomics mouse for gameplay,4,"I wanted a wireless mouse and this one fit my needs. It is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power. It can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary. The colors are a great touch and I use them depending on the mood I'm in at the time.  I also like being able to choose the resolution ""on the fly"" with the button on the top. I have already recommended it to a couple of friends.",85,4.0,2020,12,December,23

👍,1,"its so cute, slim and pretty.",6,5.0,2020,12,December,22
I love this mouse,4,Great product for the price...my daughter loves it! It is so quiet when you're clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so I have decided to purchase myself one as well!,34,5.0,2020,12,December,22
Not worth the money,4,"This mouse is amazing. I work in IT and have been working from home for quite some time. There are days where I have to work 10-12 hours. My hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time. It is super easy to setup...just connect to the USB and you’re done. The BEST part that I love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet! The weeks that I’m on-call, I do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when I have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound. I will definitely buy another one just in case if I lose it.",131,1.0,2020,12,December,22
No complaints here!,3,"If you are looking for a mouse that is small and slim, pretty color and one that lights up, this one does all of that and it is quiet.While the little booklet is in a foreign languageI am satisfied with my purchase and even though the seller offered,  no refund is necessary.",52,5.0,2020,12,December,21
Not user-friendly. I wouldn't recommend it,6,Very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn’t work. All other buttons worked thou,15,2.0,2020,12,December,21

Do not purchase,3,"There's nothing majorly, egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn't necessarily excel at anything. The mouse is pretty light, the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive. The sleep mode is a bit aggressive, and I find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and I have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again.The DPI is by far the biggest problem, it doesn't feel like the DPI switch on the mouse actually does anything, and it almost feels like the DPI changes randomly while in use. I've noticed this behavior with a mouse mat, and on a flat desk alone. This may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless.Overall, it's definitely good enough for what I needed - a cheap, wireless, rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work, however I wouldn't use it for anything beyond that.",146,1.0,2020,12,December,20
Eco friendly and bargain mouse,5,"Sweet sleek mouse with nice color, can't wait till its nighttime to show it off",15,5.0,2020,12,December,17
"Smooth tracking, satisfying clicks, RGB not as great.",8,"I like how smooth it is. It moves across the screen easily.  The buttons click nicely. My hand doesn't hurt after hours of gaming.

Great mouse,2,"I got a new MacBook Air and I wanted a wireless mouse to go with it. I found this one and liked the color-changing lights, so I bought it and received it quicker than expected, and am enjoying it. It has a rechargeable battery, so no changing batteries, which I also like. I plugged it in and it worked immediately, the only thing I would change at this point is the connector. The USB connector is standard, but it has to be plugged into another connector to use it with the USB-C connector, which is all the new MacBook has, and it sticks out an inch and a half.Overall, I am pleased with the mouse and its lights, and it works as expected.",123,5.0,2020,12,December,10

I wanted to love it,5,"1) When I opened my mouse, I noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse, towards the area where your palm would rest when in use. I also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the USB that would make the mouse compatible with my MacBook, so I had to use a different adapter. Considering I paid for a NEW $14 mouse, I was expecting to get better quality.2) Gave the mouse a second chance and this time I received one that didn't work.",91,3.0,2020,11,November,24

I like it,3,Started out and I loved this mouse butwithin 2 months it would not hold a charge for more tha a few hours.Annoying having to use it plugged in. I bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable. If it was even once a day I could handle it since I like the mouse but can't stand charging every few hours. So sad.,72,5.0,2020,11,November,21
stopped working after 4 months :(,6,"This mouse was driving me crazy at first in that I thought it wasn't working. But it had gone into its 'sleep mode'. Just give it a click to wake it up. Now that I know that, it works great. Go figure... user error.",44,2.0,2022,11,November,03
Review,1,"The good thing is this mouse is cheap, but it feels like it too.  The wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button.  other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should",52,2.0,2020,11,November,18
Not for me,3,"Very good mouse, excellent",4,3.0,2020,11,November,17
Do not buy - product doesn’t work,7,"I bought it for work. It's so smooth, color is a matte black. LED lights are so cool and fun. Doesn't make any clicking sound. Is rechargeable. I'm very happy with this purchase.",33,1.0,2020,11,November,17
Awesome buy!,2,"If you get a white mouse, be prepared that you could get one that actually looks solid like it should or transparent like the one I got. I guess sure it's pretty interesting that instead of only the perimeter of the mouse lighting up, the entire thing does. But at the same time, it takes the focus away from the design for the rgb. It makes the mouse look cheap, being able to see the skeleton of the plastic's interior. It even feels like a $7 mouse. It's only doubled the price tag bc of 2 obvious-to-see rgb leds. I would've liked it more if the leds at least blended colors, but with an obvious wall of plastic in the way, they don't even do that.Despite its looks, the mouse worked great for a couple days. The movement felt smooth, the clicking felt good and it was quiet. I noticed the red laser id not shielded at all. Also, the rgb lights stay on even when the mouse falls asleep. And unfortunately after a few days, I noticed the movement isn't very good. It may be okay for normal use but it's not acceptable for gaming. I thought it was because of the low battery power, but even at full power and changing the dpi around, the issue remains. This is gonna have to be returned.",226,5.0,2020,11,November,17
Really nice mouse!,3,This mouse is awesome.  Its sleek and it works so well.  It also looks great!,15,5.0,2020,11,November,17
Don’t work very well,4,"I purchased one of these before and it was really nice .I like the way it looks and feels it's pretty accurate and has a good sensitivity and this one I got a card in it that said I get this one for free I don't know how,.  cuz I can't read Chinese and the instructions are in Chinese.!",59,1.0,2020,11,November,16
THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD BUY,6," I like it, easy to use and carry around if needed. The box comes with a nice short charging cord and a USB --> USB C adapter for use with either the Bluetooth receiver or the charging cord. Nice addition that's come in handy. I don't like how long it takes for it to wake up, though. Not sure what the time frame is on when it goes to sleep, but if I'm reading something or just have my computer on for a video or music, I just turn the mouse off all together. It's quicker to just flick it back on than it is to jiggle it around to wake it. Rainbow colors are fun, holds a charge for a long time. I can work pretty much the whole week before noticing its lagging and probably could use a charge. This makes it a lot friendlier to use over batteries. I'll take the sluggish sleep mode over the clunky mouse styles with repeat battery replacements. Good find for the money!",171,1.0,2020,11,November,15

Recharging is a pain,4,"This is really a ball to use. It does exactly what the description says: change colors slowly and continuously. Also it has two modes: color change, or battery-saving single color. But the battery lasts for hours and it is as easy to recharge as a cellphone. In fact, you can plug it into a USB outlet on your laptop or whatever and it will charge in no time. The only problem I have with it is that, occasionally, the cursor on my laptop will jump from one side of the screen to the other, or from bottom to top, etc. I have no idea why that happens, and it can be annoying, which is why 4 stars instead of 5.",120,3.0,2020,11,November,11

Very comfortable and responsive!,4,"I believe this is a great purchase, the size is not too small and not too large, its shape is thin but comfortable. The lighting is glamorous. I do use it on my laptop at home, about 3x a week, because of this, I shut the mouse off to save on the charge. But, I have to say that the charge does hold for a long time.  If you forget, a cord is provided and it measures about 10'' long, which is perfect to plug in and continue to use the mouse as you work.  The price is reasonable and worth it. I would like to purchase another for work, but fear that its projected beauty may peek someone's interest.",120,5.0,2020,11,November,05
Great for the money,4,"I got this specifically since it was smaller than the gaming mouse I had, this slim mouse feels nicer in my hand. The only thing is that occasionally the cursor lags/jumps a bit but it doesn’t happen too often. Otherwise I love that it’s chargeable and wireless. I don’t keep the flashy lights on too often to conserve the battery. Nice cheap mouse.",63,5.0,2020,11,November,05

It is silent and feels nice in my hand.",61,1.0,2020,11,November,04
My daughter loves it,4,I got this mouse for my 9 year daughter for Christmas. She loves how it fits her hands and how is changes colors.

I don't use them in general often, but ended up buying one because my laptop doesn't love to let me use the keypad and wasd while gaming without delaying one or the other slightly.  I wasn't necessarily expecting transitioning to using a mouse to be easy, but it really has been!  It has no lag while I'm gaming at all, is very smooth gliding, doesn't hurt my wrists at all, and holds a charge for a long time.  I have forgotten to turn it off several times, and gone back to use it a few days later and it was still plenty charged enough for a couple of hours of gameplay.

But the white mouse I ordered was more of a transparent white so the lights made the mouse look like something I bought at a swap meet. Super cheap! Now for the function-- It worked great for a few months then the sensor on the bottom started to get an attitude with me. I wanted to go to the right of my screen and it would want to go left. I attempted to perform an exorcism on it just in case there was a demon possessing it. Either I did it wrong or the demon was too powerful for my faith or the mouse is malfunctioning.

Lasted exactly 3 months,4,i love it its quiet and rainbows and sleek.,9,1.0,2022,11,November,05
Receiver gets stuck,3,Lasted exactly 3 months then stopped working properly.  I really loved the feel and accuracy when it worked but would expect better quality. wouldn't scroll and became jerky.,28,2.0,2022,11,November,05
Good for its price,4,"The receiver is located at the bottom of the mouse, which is theory is a great idea. However, it’s stuck way too deep and I can’t get it out without breaking something. Very sad!",34,5.0,2022,11,November,04
Worked well but didn't last,5,Good mouse for the price!,5,2.0,2022,11,November,04
Click to wake,3,"I love how you can plug it into a USB charger or into the USB on the device to charge. I say durable because I have dropped mine, stepped on it, you make it and it still works as good as day one!",43,5.0,2022,11,November,04
Rechargeable Mouse,2,This mouse is more comfortable than my older model.  It's accurate and quick when I use it.  The sleep mode works great and it holds a charge longer than I expected it would.  So far it works as it should and the colors are a cute feature.,47,5.0,2022,11,November,03
Smoothe to use,3,"I liked this mouse until it broke. Two days outside of the return window. The roller for the scroll function broke, while I was scrolling. I was nothing but gentle with this mouse and it only lasted 32 days.It is nice looking, the colored lights are not obnoxious, and it is very quiet.",53,5.0,2022,11,November,03
Not impressed,2,"Seems to hold a charge for a long time - so far I've charged every couple of days.I work from home, so my mouse gets a lot of use.  I got tired of replacing batteries in my other ones.",39,2.0,2022,11,November,03
Broke quickly,2,This thing is awesome everyone at work has asked me were i got it,14,1.0,2022,11,November,02
Bad experience,2,"First the roller broke, then the left button.  The LED lights are pretty cool though.",15,1.0,2022,11,November,02
Great,1,"Careful with this one.  I bought it last month, the return window closed Oct 12 and it broke today.  Any chance of a good will exchange folks?",27,5.0,2022,11,November,02
Great for kids,3,"Bought this mouse as the color and LED’s were quite cool. Would expect it to work like a normal mouse but when clicking, one has to click quite hard for it to work. Moreover, there is a lag when moving the cursor while using the mouse. Thought it was a battery issue but even after charging it, the same thing happened.",61,5.0,2022,11,November,02
It's easy to handle. Nice little lights that won't disturb someone sleeping.,12,It works,2,5.0,2022,11,November,01
Nice mouse,2,My son loves this he had another mouse and he lost the piece and this is a good replacement I love the slick design,24,4.0,2022,11,November,01
Good customer service - wish the mouse had performed as well,11,I like the the ease of use. I don't go through batteries because it's chargeable. The light is not over bearing. The lights don't disturb sleeping loved ones. The ergonomic design is easy on the hands. Overall it's a nice and easy product to use.,45,3.0,2022,10,October,31
Probably wouldn’t recommend,3,"It's nice. It lights up. Has a good feel while in your hand. Stayed charged for a good bit after the 1st charge. However after it died the first time, it doesn't hold charge for very long now. Its not bad for someone who doesn't use it daily. I'm constantly using my computer so it dying after 1 days use is a pain and I don't have time to let it charge for forever. I went back to using a battery mouse.",82,2.0,2022,10,October,31
"It works great. I don't game, this was for my work computer",12,"My first mouse I ordered in July 2022 started acting wild - not able to control where the cursor went. I contacted the company, and they did send me a new one to replace and did not ask for me to return the first one. Which was great; however, the roller on the second mouse has now stopped working. It is a great looking and comfortable mouse - wished it had worked. Afraid to try a third.",77,5.0,2022,10,October,31
Nice idea,2,The mouse itself is beautiful. The lights make it 10x better. I’m rating this a 2 because it worked good for the first few days but after that I noticed that it randomly stops working even after it’s fully charged. I have to move the switch to off and back on for it to work. Sometimes it still lags or cuts off and I literally have to keep it on charge for it to work continuously. I don’t think it’s going into sleep mode because it does it sometimes while I’m actively using the mouse.,95,2.0,2022,10,October,31
Not worth it,3,Using with my new laptop.,5,1.0,2022,10,October,31
Love It,2,Love the lights and it's comfortable to use.,8,5.0,2022,10,October,31
Doesn’t charge. Cant turn on,5,I really wanted a rechargeable mouse as I use a lot of batteries in my regular wireless mouse.  I work in a fast paced computer orientated office. I type fast and navigate faster. The mouse couldn’t keep up.  Often found myself turning it off and back on because it just wouldn’t move. Returned it for a refund.,57,1.0,2022,10,October,31
Love he colors,3,Doesn't work after less than 30 days of having it,10,3.0,2022,10,October,31
Good for the price,4,Love this mouse. Just what I was looking for,9,4.0,2022,10,October,31
A little low if you use a gel pad on your mouse pad.,13,I use this for my laptop I needed a silent wireless mouse. It’s wireless and silent. The roll ball button is loud like a regular mouse but left and right are quiet. I charged it used it once the next day I tried to charge it and cut it on it wouldn’t come on. Or the red light flashed and immediately went off. I wouldn’t buy this.,67,4.0,2022,10,October,31

I hope you have better luck with this mouse than I...,11,"Only lasted about a year, but worked great for that year, so I just pretend they're like the old Bic lighters, disposable.  This is my second one, we'll see if it lasts a year, longer or less.",37,1.0,2022,10,October,29
Not worth it,3,The mouse scroller broke within a month,7,2.0,2022,10,October,29
Roller ball stopped working within 4 months of minimal use,10,I wish I would have gotten one earlier. I love it and it makes working in my laptop so much easier,21,1.0,2022,10,October,29
Cute little mouse,3,I had no issues with the mouse but I dropped it from not even 2ft from the ground (on accident of course) and the spin wheel and the left clicker broke. I’ve ordered another one and I hope it lasts longer than this one did.,45,5.0,2022,10,October,24
Easy in all ways,4,Bought 7 months ago now I have to charge it every other day.,13,5.0,2022,10,October,24
Works great.,2,Does what its meant for,5,5.0,2022,08,August,30
The mouse will not hold a charge,7,"I've learned this lesson (again). Open the package and use the product right away. I ordered this mouse in August as my 'travel' mouse and just packed it away in my bag. Now, I've been visiting family in the PNW since mid-September. The mouse took a charge and worked fine for a couple of weeks. After I recharged the mouse, it worked for a day or two and then ceased to function. The optical light will flash once when turned on then.... nothing. Of course, the return window is well past.",91,1.0,2022,10,October,29

Wheel broken after 2 months,5,I like the color and size but it’s a few days out of the return period and it will not hold a charge,23,1.0,2022,10,October,27
Stopped working,2,"Overall I love this mouse. The size, weight, clicking is all fabulous. However I’ve had two of these now and the middle scroller has randomly fallen in without rough use, it wasn’t dropped, literally was not even touching it the second time and I heard it fall. If you need to use the middle scroller a lot I do not recommend purchase. If you don’t use that feature then it’s a great mouse.",73,1.0,2022,10,October,27
Lag time seems higher than expected,6,It stopped working,3,3.0,2022,10,October,27
In less than 3 month I now need to charge daily or every other day (and I am not gaming with it),22,"My son uses a school issued Chromebook for school work and hates using the touch pad to navigate the mouse. So we looked into a wireless mouse and found this one had so many good reviews. Unfortunately, the scrolling wheel has already broken and he has only used it a month. Since he only uses it for his school computer it mostly stayed stored safely in the carrying case. He was not rough with it and it was stored carefully when not in use. I am really disappointed because he loved the color and paid for this with his own money earned helping his grandmother over the summer at a campground. There is an email on the bottom of the mouse that says lifetime replacement but I have tried twice now to email them about it and it keeps bouncing back as undeliverable. I am sure this has been a great product for many and we likely got the dud so I am not telling anyone not to buy it but I am sharing our experience for others to consider.",180,1.0,2022,10,October,27
Cheaply made,2,Loved this cute little mouse but it broke after 2 months. The wheel broke off from the gear.,18,2.0,2022,10,October,27
Mouse stopped working within 2 months of purchase,8,Should've spent the money to get a quality product. This thing stopped working after about a week. Worthless,18,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Broke within 3 months,4,"Beautifully produced and lovely to look at for a mouse.  The lights are a welcome addition to an otherwise drab workspace.  I did notice that it tends to go into a sleep mode quickly, but takes a longer ‘wake up’ time than I expect.  On a screen busy with windows, the cursor freezes in position until the mouse fully comes back to life.  It’s frustrating for anyone who isn’t patient.",70,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Keeps breaking,2,"Loved this at first. However, battery is pretty much shot. I am only using it with a home entertainment system (computer), so it isn't getting used a lot. However, in less than 3 months, I new need to charge it daily or at least every other day.I'm not sure the sleep function is working. I may try turning it off after every use to charge it less often, but that will become annoying super fast, even if it does work. It will likely end up in the trash before long.",90,3.0,2022,10,October,26
Nothing but issues,3,First one broke in 1 week they sent a replacement and I returned broken one and it still hasn’t processed return now new one broke 2 weeks later.  I would not recommend this mouse,34,1.0,2022,10,October,26
It doesn’t charge,3,I don't typically write reviews but I keep having this issue with tech products from amazon. The mouse stopped working after 2 months of use. It charges and sometimes I can get short term use out of it but it's very glitchy and lags across the screen.,47,1.0,2022,10,October,26
Disappointed,1,I liked the wireless mouse however after 3 months the roller on the mouse stopped working which leaves me not being able to scroll up or down on my pc. I’ll have to look into buying a more sturdy mouse.,40,1.0,2022,10,October,26

Only lasted 7 mos!,4,"I bought this in late June, it looks cool with the lights and all. It doesn't give a warning that the battery is low, just stops working.

A bit disappointing,3,After a few weeks the scroll wheel stopped working. I'm returning it.,12,3.0,2022,10,October,25
Broke down after less than a year,7,This is the second time I have ordered this mouse. I actually really like the mouse except for the fact that they keep breaking and I have to order a new one.

After 7 months won't hold a charge!,7,"Bought this mouse on December 2021. Its October 2022 and no matter how long I charge it, the only thing it does is blink the red light once and die. Don't recommend this at all.",35,2.0,2022,10,October,25
doesn't recharge very easily,4,"It works ok.  Nothing spectacular.  If you're a gamer or use the mouse quite a bit, you have to charge it about once a day, or it starts lagging and causes things to crash or freeze up due to the lag.",41,2.0,2022,10,October,25
I would not hold a charge,6,Unfortunately this mouse stopped working after a month of use. Can I replace the item or get a refund?,19,1.0,2022,10,October,24
Not too pleased,3,I bought this mouse to go with my work laptop when I have to travel to sites. I HATE using the pad that is built into the laptop. This is cute and little. I am thinking about using it for my personal laptop when gaming or doing school work.,49,2.0,2022,10,October,24

I Do NOT recommend it!!,5,"I’ve actually purchased two of these and both broke in the same way, the scroller. I do not recommend if you need them for any kind of gaming that requires the scroller. I need to use it for camera angles in game and without it gameplay is awful. I won’t be buying a third one, BUT if that’s not gonna be a problem for you then these will probably be great. They hold a charge well and the light show they put on is really cool.",86,3.0,2022,10,October,24

Poor Quality,2,"As a lot of other reviewers said, the scroll wheel broke. I have had a different USB mouse for years without this problem. I'll be going back to it.The battery life is also very short. I'm constantly having to recharge it.",41,1.0,2022,10,October,23

Super disappointing,2,Repeatedly and without proper functioning my mouse turned on for 1 second then turned right back off again after being plugged into the laptop overnight.

"Nice, but...",2,"This mouse would not connect to my compute despite multiple attempts following the instructions given. As is typical of many Amazon products, this product is cheaply made and not worth wasting your money on.I would suggest avoiding making purchases from this brand in the future, and strongly suggest NOT BUYING THIS MOUSE. Unless throwing money away on broken pieces of junk that don't work is a past time of yours. Then knock yourself out.",74,4.0,2022,10,October,12

"Great for one month, then not so great.",8,"I like how slim it is, and the colors are a nice touch without being distracting.

Scroll Wheel Broke after two months,6,"Love the color, love how it changes colors and love how it holds a charge!",15,1.0,2022,10,October,10
Garbage,1,"I bought this mouse because it said it was rechargeable and I wouldn’t have to remember to always have batteries around. I used it for a few days and once the better inside died, I went to recharge it. I charged it for 5+ hours (even though it says the charge time is 2-3 hours) and then went to go use it and it does not work",67,2.0,2022,10,October,10

Good but…,2,Works on MacBook Pro.,4,3.0,2022,10,October,10
You have to remember to turn on,7,"I loved this little mouse. It looked great. It felt great in my hand. The wheel was nice for scrolling. The battery even held a charge for what I thought was a reasonable amount of time. I would categorize my usage as light-moderate use (and no abuse).Then came the day, about a month after arrival, right after the return window closed, that it started glitching. Now, it drops off, not responding, then will work again, then drop off again and I’m not talking about sleep mode- this is during active use. Back and forth. Back and forth. It’s frustrating, probably more because I so desperately want a mouse instead of my laptop’s trackpad.All that said, I didn’t spend a whole lot of money on this mouse, so I get what I pay for. I just wish I had gotten a little more than a month before the glitching.",148,4.0,2022,10,October,10

still works,2,"I got this for my mother because she wanted something pink and cheap. It really feels like its made of trash. It does seem to work well enough, though the tracking is inconsistent at best. The ergonomics are really non existent, doesn't seem like it's made for human hands.Overall, if you're buying for somebody who wants something cheap and pink and cant tell the difference go for it, but if you actually care about having a half decent mouse skip this one.",82,5.0,2022,10,October,10

Cheaply made,2,"I really liked this mouse when I first got it. It was low profile, had a nice soft and quiet click, had rainbow lights, and was available in a rose gold color. I thought I'd made a great purchase. Now, I've had it for less than 2 months and the scroll wheel is so squeaky. I can't stand to hear it when I'm scrolling through documents.

I do not recommend,4,"Just plugged it in and it worked perfectly.  I wanted a small, low profile mouse to use when I travel, so far this one seems great.  The Chromebook I travel with only has usb-C ports, and I did think that that this mouse came with a usb-c receiver, but it doesn't.  It comes with usb receiver and an adapter which works fine but together they are over an inch long which is a little awkward.  It means I have to be very careful not to bump it and beak it.  If the receiver were smaller this would be ideal.  Overall, great value.",102,1.0,2022,10,October,02

Almost on the 2 month mark exactly, the scroll wheel stopped working...it just spins and doesn't move the cursor up and down the page.

"It's great, functional....until it's not",5,It’s a joke. We tried for a long time to get the mouse to even work and it doesn’t. Even after trying the mouse on multiple surfaces and troubleshooting thinking it was our computer.

Cheap mouse with bad scroller,5,This mouse did horrible things to my laptop. I no longer have working USB hubs. Also I get a warning message about a malfunction on the computer and that does not go away and if I get it to go away I constantly have a flashing image in the bottom right hand corner of my laptop screen. I took this mouse and my laptop computer to Best Buy and it was determined that the mouse had indeed ruined the USB hubs and I would have had to have sent my computer off for repair and I cannot do that because the laptop is for business.

Great,1,"The center scroll wheel lasted less than a week. The mouse itself still works, but it is aggravating that every time you use muscle memory to scroll with a wheel that doesn't work. Decent battery life. Bought a new, different brand mouse to replace it. The mouse also doesn't have much of an arch to it, so its not very ergonomic. Its better than a laptop track-pad though.",68,5.0,2022,09,September,06

I unplugged the mouse to see if it had any any charge.....No charge at all. So now I have to explain to my 10 yr old that the company gave her a broken mouse and try to find a way to to get it work with her device while always charging.

Not for me,3,"Works great.  It’s a little too small and would stress my hand if I used it all day, everyday, but I don’t. So I’m keeping it and am content.  To be more specific, the buttons are not directly below my fingertips (which would be solved by a longer mouse OR an ergonomic one that has a little more height to it.). I’m an averaged sized male, and to my knowledge my hand is typical of that size of person haha.  Hope this helps.",83,1.0,2022,09,September,02

The new mouse came scratched (not a big deal) and the scroll wheel wasn't as smooth (annoying but its fine) but this one's cursor is jumping around the screen too!

Broke in a week,4,"I used this mouse for work as I am a hybrid worker and do most work in the field or different workspaces. When the mouse leaves my home office to go with me, it has its own individual protective/padded case in my work bag.  Worked great until it just stopped working, which is very disappointing after almost 4 months.The mouse still lights up, looks like it works, took a charge from the charger, but will not move on the screen in my work computer (Thinkpad) or personal computer (MacBook). That said, either the mouse internally stopped working in some aspect or the USB dongle is defective per my IT consultant. I tried all possible USB ports, even those on my Apple Magic keyboard and still does not move on the screen. I also tried every idea I could find to reset/repair the issue in line to no avail.It is disappointing and a huge inconvenience this happened. You would expect a product to last more than 4 months. For my coworkers that asked about my mouse as they thought it was cool, they will now be told it died only after a short period of time and cautioned if they decide to buy one.I have yet to hear back from their customer service. And not sure I ever will. Maybe it is true after all, you get what you pay for. Now I need to buy another new mouse, which was something I hoped to not have to worry about for a long time.Please keep in mind, I do not leave this review to bash the company. This review is to let people know my experience with the mouse. Like I said, it worked great until it just stopped working (still lights up, just will not move on my screen) for no apparent reason as it work the night before (8/30/22).Buyer beware.",311,1.0,2022,08,August,29

I don't have the largest hands, but not very small either and a mouse with a high hump is very uncomfortable. This solves that problem nicely. I could do without the sleep mode; I am still getting used to waking it up, and i understand the value of sleep mode so I deal with it. Never having to deal with batteries is also a bonus. Charging it overnight is ideal but I have already forgotten a couple of nights and it's fine. If necessary, you can plug it in and use it while it charges.",114,2.0,2022,08,August,26

Poor quality,2,"I loved this mouse so much that I bought one for my daughter and my mom. I’ve only had this for less than 2 months and it just stopped working.

Broke in less than two months,6,"I bought this mouse to replace one that had the mousewheel break.  To be honest, I loved this mouse  at first - the lights, the feel, everything.  However, I was not a fan of the extra added adapter to make it USB-C compatible.  Here I am 2 months after I bought it and the mousewheel no longer functions on this mouse as well.  For some reason the companies that make these portable mouse (mice?) cannot make one that has a sturdy mouse wheel.  Oddly enough, the one thing I didn't like about the mouse originally, became my favorite thing now that it is broken - the adapter to allow me to run regular USB on a USB-C port.",118,1.0,2022,08,August,25

Mouse will not work,4,This product is very cheaply made. I purchased this mouse because my daughter liked the lighting on the side of the mouse.  However the wheel that controls how you scroll up and down on a web page easily  breaks off and you have to return it or buy another one.  Buyer beware take it from a father who has went through 3 of them.,64,2.0,2022,08,August,25
Bad,1,I use this for my laptop mostly when I'm creating designs on my cricut. Works good! Lights up very nicely.,20,1.0,2022,06,June,14
JUNK,1,I use this mouse for work. It didn’t require any weird setup like downloading software. It’s super comfy and has a sleep mode that activates after about 15 minutes. A click of the button wakes it up and it’s ready to go. I don’t regularly use the light up mode but it is a cool feature that is fun to show off. I have carpal tunnel and it’s so much better on my wrist than a standard wired computer mouse. Most definitely worth the purchase!,85,1.0,2022,08,August,25
Broke within a month.,4,The scroll wheels does not work on this mouse,9,1.0,2022,08,August,25
Easy to use,3,The mouse itself is great - works well. however the roller ball on the top of the mouse broke and no longer works. It has only been 6 weeks since purchase.I do like that the lights have an on/off function so you don't need to have it lit all the time which makes it more appropriate when in a work environment.,61,5.0,2022,08,August,24
LED Wireless Mouse,3,I use this in class and at home and there is not any noise when you are clicking the buttons. Which is nice when we are quietly working on things. I would highly recommend! The color changing is also great!,40,5.0,2022,08,August,24
It stopped working less than an hour after purchase,9,I guess almost a year for under $10 is good enough.  Especially if you want one that recharges because you don't like fooling around with AA batteries. Battery life was good. I could use it all day with no problems.,40,1.0,2022,08,August,24
Does not work good,4,"About 7 weeks, after return window closed, quit working completely. I should have returned sooner as the charge lasts only about one full work day.

Really cool looking and easy to use,7,Good,1,5.0,2022,08,August,24
Horrible!,1,It was most important to me to have a quiet scrolling mouse for my laptop. This mouse has quiet/silent scrolling and silent clicking. Very impressed! The mouse is more of a flat design. The lights around it are pretty neat. There is an on/off switch on the bottom of the mouse that includes an option for the lights as well. Nice mouse for a great price.,66,1.0,2022,08,August,23
favorite mouse ever,3,It was fine until it just stopped working 3 months in. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a well known brand like Logitech.,29,5.0,2022,08,August,23
Scroll wheel broke 2 hours after started using,8,"I bought five of them this year and three already broke after a few months of light use. Two had the plastic wheel axle broken, the another one just stopped charging and not recognized by Windows anymore. In addition, the USB dongle cover separated and got stuck in the laptop USB port. This mouse is flimsy and does not last. Not very ergonomical as well. Cool lights is the only positive thing to say about this mouse, but it eats battery. Avoid.",82,1.0,2022,08,August,23

Worked great,2,"I have logitech keyboard that I use with no problem with my other mouse, but when i plug this mouse in, the keyboard stops working.

After 2 months mouse is KAPUT!,6,"This mouse has The Quietest click of any mouse I've ever owned. And it puts itself to sleep if I don't move it for a while. It's magical.

Very pleased with this purchase.",64,1.0,2022,08,August,20
Died within one month,4,Broke within two hours of using it you really gotta watch the Amazon return policy on electronics I have a tendency to buy it and I leave it sitting in the box for way too long.

Short Lifespan,2," The ergonomic feel of the mouse is great and the battery life is amazing. It is lightweight and feels cheap. White matches my setup but it’s translucent and takes way from the aesthetic. It is connected less than a ft away and it still loses connectivity which causes it to lag. It makes it completely useless to me. I don’t recommend you buy it, at least not the white one and be aware of the lagging.",76,3.0,2022,08,August,19
Ugh,1,"Great product, very competitive price.",5,1.0,2022,08,August,19
Roller wheel broke after just one year.,7,I really like this. This is a replacement for a broken battery operated one I used to have. I love that this can charge from a USB port and I'm not having to rely on batteries or worry that they might run out at an inconvenient time. It's got cool lights around the side and it works well on a lot of surfaces. I use my laptop in a recliner chair and this works running on the edge of the chair just fine. I've also used it on wooden table top and vinyl countertop surfaces with good results. It does take just a second when the laptop boots up to locate but that's minimal. The USB wireless component is small and fits really inconspicuously into an unused port on my laptop without being in the way at all. All in all I've been very happy with the quality and efficiency. This was a great purchase.,155,3.0,2022,08,August,19
The rechargeable feature is great until you forget to recharge,10,I have never used it because everything is in Chinese even the machine it self .,16,5.0,2022,08,August,19
Helps with my carpal tunnel,5,I like that you change button on the back so it stays red and that the blue light stops showing once its done charging. The only thing is I wish it would show you how much battery it has left.,40,5.0,2022,08,August,18
very happy with the performance,5,Good for the price. It also doesn't make the typical mouse clicking sound. You can barely hear it.,18,5.0,2022,08,August,18

Good Mouse,2,I loved this product when I first received it. It lit up and lightweight and just pretty. But that was very short lived. It stopped working after just 2 weeks of using it. Good thing it was on the cheaper side. Maybe it was a disposable mouse that only was supposed to work for a short period?,57,5.0,2022,08,August,17

Not worth even the little it costs,7,"When my 5 year old wired mouse finally died I started looking at replacement options.  I have never liked wireless mice due to the constant need for batteries and finding some in the office or while traveling is always a huge pain.  Finding out that there are rechargeable options out there was a game changer.  So far after about two weeks of use I love feel of the mouse, the pointer speed which is adjustable, and well the fact that I just plug it in to charge.  While the receiver is USB A and comes with an adapter for USB C, the charging port on the mouse is micro USB, the charging cable that comes with is USB A to micro USB (~6 inches) incase you want a longer one like I did.  One thing though, I do have small hands so the size is perfect, someone with small to medium sized hands will like the feel and size of the mouse, if you have large hands it may feel to small.All in all I liked it so much I ordered a 2nd one for my work laptop bag to replace the wired mouse that I travel with.",198,1.0,2022,08,August,15

Excellent device. I'm loving it.,5,"After two days of using , the mouse went dead and would not work again no matter how long I charged it .",23,5.0,2022,08,August,10
Doesn't last.,2,"I'd gotten a mouse/ mouse pad combo at TJ Maxx, but there was no usb to connect it to my laptop-- so i ordered this online. It was a good price and shipped quickly, and I am so glad I ordered it. It's way cooler than the other one I bought and feels like it's made better. It lights up, there's an on/off and sleep mode to preserve battery. Also works so seamlessly and smooth. Great product, thanks!",78,1.0,2022,08,August,10
Perfect,1,I received this product in the mail and when first handled it felt very cheap.. I proceeded to use it on my laptop and the mouse wheel wasn’t working at all,31,5.0,2022,08,August,10
Low profile,2,"the mouse itself was fine at first, worked great and i liked the shape and sound. but the wheel started to squeak, and it always scrolled too fast for my liking. and now the mouse won’t work at all, always jumping around the screen, spinning, lagging, or unresponsive. really annoying when i’m trying to play games. it does this when the battery is getting low too. not a fan. it works sometimes flat on my desktop but then it slowly gets worse and worse as the night goes on. and now it won’t even read on my mousepad at all? it HAS to be on the desktop to make it work, even poorly.",113,5.0,2022,08,August,10
Color chips off easily,4,"I really loved this mouse.  I did not replace it with the same mouse, however because the wheel broke.  I only use this device M-F for work.  I'm not a gamer or anything like that.  I've had wireless mice that do not break for years previously.  Great color, very cool looking.  Will miss using this.  Not sure if there is any warranty",62,3.0,2022,08,August,10
Not worth the price,4,"I liked everything about this mouse, was working great the couple of times a week that I used it. Then one day… the scroll wheel stopped working completely. No it’s not dirty, there is no resistance it feels like it is free wheeling in there. No explanation. Past “return period.”",50,2.0,2022,08,August,10
It's broken,2,Be sure your computer is on in order to see the lights on the white mouse :) was so close to returning it as my other mouse with lights was always on regardless of my computer. But glad I problem solved my own problem!,44,1.0,2022,08,August,10

Fun Mouse,2,"It is quite nice, it has an interesting style and the colored lights give it a special touch, unfortunately in terms of performance is lousy, the sleep mode seems to fail constantly, sometimes it turns off for no reason and stops working for a while (being fully charged) so it must be damaged internally. Very disappointed with this product, no matter how nice it is it is not worth buying if it does not fulfill its main function.",78,4.0,2022,08,August,09

Mouse for work,3,Great purchase,2,3.0,2022,08,August,08
Broken Roller,2,"Pretty easy to use and set up, comes with a charger. I expected the lights to be a bit more appealing but they’re mainly just solid colors when you have it on the led light mode. Fits snug with my hands and does the job for the most part so complain. Probably wouldn’t use for gaming purposes though.",58,3.0,2022,08,August,07
Didn’t work,2,"Nice mouse -- if it worked! The first one I purchased worked for about a month. When the scrolling wheel broke, the company replaced it, free of charge. Now, six months later, the second one has quit working; won't hold a charge.",42,1.0,2022,08,August,07

Piece of crap,3,Mouse is easy to use and works well. However the first time I put it in my bag the color chipped off the mouse. Now I have a teal mouse with white specks. Super disappointed,35,1.0,2022,08,August,06
Terrible Product,2,This is the cheapest thing I have ever seen the quality is horrible! Holding it in my hand feels like it weighs nothing it is extremely cheap. The lights are neat tho. They should be ashamed selling this for anymore then 2$,42,1.0,2022,08,August,05

Junk!,1,Mouse works well and holds a charge for several 8 hour work days. Only drawback for me is that the scroll wheel is loud.,24,1.0,2022,08,August,04
Very lightweight,2,"After exactly two months the roller wheel in the middle broke. I tried prying it apart and it is not fixable and is a pain to always have to use the scrollbar with the mouse. The lights are kind of distracting & not necessary. However, it does stay charged for a week or more at a time. I'm cheap and bought this for data work. It works (other than the middle wheel now) and is okay for the price or if you don't have high expectations.",86,5.0,2022,08,August,03

mouse jumps all over the screen,6,Have not even had the item for three weeks and it has stopped connecting.  It was going strong for about a week and then all of a sudden it began to have problems.

Pretty but not a good fit with Apple products,9,Is very easy to manager.,5,1.0,2022,08,August,02
Terrible quality! Stopped working after a few months!,8,"It stopped working after 1-2 Weeks. The lights would appear and it looked like it would charge, but the mouse was nonresponsive to movement. It worked for a week or two before this happened, so I know how it was supposed to work before it stopped working. The surface felt silky to the touch, but that's about the only plus I can give this product. As cool as the lights look, I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this. Invest a little extra and go with a more reputable and reliable brand that won't break after 1-2 weeks. I'll be doing the same after this disappointment.",106,1.0,2022,08,August,02

Colorful,1,"This mouse is super cute! It is lightweight, and the color matched perfectly to the picture (I got dark gray to match my Macbook Pro). The click is silent, which I love. The LED lights are bright and colorful. There is also a setting where you can just have red lights, but I love the color changing. The only downside is that this mouse does not hold a charge long enough to last my entire workday. I've started switching it off when I am away from my desk, and that help some. Charging is simple, though.",96,5.0,2022,07,July,31
I 💗 My Pink Mouse...,5,"I loved the look and feel of this mouse. However, it stopped working after only a week of using. It won’t charge at all and a coworker said she had the same issue with the same mouse. Don’t waste your money!",41,5.0,2022,07,July,31
Works,1,"I was pleased to see just how well made the mouse was when I received it. I couldn't have asked for more for the money. It's comfortable in my hand. The rubber texture really makes using it a pleasure. The dongle storage on the bottom of the mouse isn't covered, but it's nice and tight, so I'm not worried about losing it. So far so good!",66,4.0,2022,07,July,31

This morning I go to use the mouse and it still is not working, despite it being fully charged. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I am extremely disappointed because I just bought this mouse on June 29th, meaning that the return window closed on July 29th. This mouse stopped working entirely (doesn't even turn on anymore) two days after the return window closed. Do not buy this product!!! If I could give it less stars I would.",101,1.0,2022,07,July,31

bad one,2,Wet sleek and love the silent clicks and the lights.very satisfied with it,13,1.0,2022,07,July,31
Mouse,1,"This came with an adaptor to fit the Apple laptop, but is not made specifically for Apple products. The charge does not last long and needs a special adaptor. I prefer a battery operated mouse as maintaining so many different chargers on my desk is cumbersome.  The three settings for on off are also less than ideal.

A waste of money,4,"Update - I lost my favorite mouse today. I bought it on Jun 12, 2022, reviewed it Aug 1, 2022, and it died yesterday, Aug 2, 2022. So the mouse lasted appx 11 weeks. Two and a half months is a pretty disappointing lifespan. The battery died so I plugged it in, as always, yet it doesn't connect anymore. I've tried removing the USB transmitter, rebooting the computer, plunging it in and out, and turning it off and on, but nothing. I even tried 're-charging' it, but nope. It's a lost cause.I bought this mouse to replace the wireless Logitech I was using for my laptop. It died and I decided to try this rechargeable mouse from OKIMO. I never heard of the brand but I'm impressed.This first charge lasted so long that I almost forgot it was rechargeable. I bought it in mid-June (It's Aug 1, 2022 today) and I'm just on my second charge. The first charge lasted over a month.This mouse does shut off after it's idle for a while and I'm sure that is the secret to the long battery life. Just a quick left click and it's back in business almost immediately.I love the slim feel of this mouse. It works beautifully.I thought the changing light would bother me (I'm old - 57) but it doesn't. It's more like a pleasant subdued highlight effect.I'll probably buy another one for my desktop but in another color so I don't get them mixed up.",247,1.0,2022,07,July,29

Stopped working after a couple months,6, Aesthetically this is very enjoyable to use because of the changing colors of the rainbow. I like how it's wireless and it can even work from a small distance away on another table from separate from my computer. It works very well. It has an on and off button for storage.,51,1.0,2022,07,July,28

Scroll wheel broke,3,It works,2,1.0,2022,07,July,28
Great Upgrade,2,"This thing works well most of the time. If you don’t turn it off and just let it go to sleep mode, it dies fairly quickly but you still get a couple of days of use out of it (if you’re not using it 8 hours a day, at least). If you turn it off every time you’re done though you can get probably a month but at least 2 weeks out of it with moderate use. I originally bought it to use with my iPad, however the case on my iPad wouldn’t really allow the USB-C to plug into the charger port. I wish they made an option to get either a USB or a USB-C plug as you get both with this mouse but you have to plug the USB into the USB-C adapter which makes the USB-C plug significantly thicker than necessary. Now I use it for my MacBook. Just a warning, if you want it to scroll like a regular mouse you have to change it in the setting of the computer (but that’s a MacBook problem not a problem with this mouse, not all of Apple’s setting decisions make sense but that’s nothing new). I do really like that I can chose to just turn on the mouse with a solid red color (which preserves battery) or turn it on to change colors (reduces how much time you get out of the mouse but is a cool feature). My only complaint is that sometimes the mouse isn’t tracking perfectly and the cursor is in a completely different place than I would expect it to be (further behind where I was moving it to rather than the cursor doing its own thing), but that may also be a thing I have to change on the laptop.",300,5.0,2022,07,July,28

cheap quality,2,"I've been using Logitech Marble Mice for years, maybe over a decade.  I just love that you control the cursor with just your fingertips.  But it's weakness is that the Marble Mouse's scrolling function is clumsy and jerky as it lacks a legit scroll wheel.  That is probably the sole reason I bought this LED wireless mouse.The LED mouse seems to function well.  It has a sleep mode that easily wakes up and had a pretty color light around it.  I don't use it for general mousing, but for scrolling.  Once i get the cursor in the right window the mouse can be on the desk, in my lap. wherever.  It makes up for what I don't have with my Marble Mouse.  The price was right and I think if it's what I paid for it it's a good, cheap addition.",141,1.0,2022,07,July,27

Nice mouse,2,This mouse is extremely lightweight and easy to use. I love the lights that constantly change while you're using it. The best part for me is the fact that it's rechargeable...just plug it into any USB (I plug it into my laptop at the end of the day) battery usually lasts me a few full days of work.

Battery Free Mouse,3,"I bought the white one and at first it was only lighting up red and thought the picture was misleading. I then realized the on/off switch on the bottom actually serves two functions. One click on will turn the mouse on and glowing red. Two clicks on and the rainbow colors appear. I will say the white mouse is almost translucent, the rainbow colors illuminate the whole mouse, not just the sides. It's plug and play, very easy to use and comfortable.",82,2.0,2022,07,July,26
Broke,1,"This is probably my second review in life because I hate leaving them. But I'm very disappointed that the scroll wheel stopped working right after a month of use. I don't even use it every day. Hell, I don't even use it every other day, so this definite came as a shock. Of course, the return window is closed, which go figure when you sell a cheap mouse and the seller isn't easily accessible. I'd like to think out of good character and business that I would be able to replace this mouse as I love the color and the lights on it, but what's the point if it no longer serves its purpose ???",115,3.0,2022,07,July,26

Excellent!,1,"At first, this mouse was the best ever. However, whenever it touches a table, the bottom red light turns on and makes the colors look all messed up. It was still very comfortable, though. However, 2-3 months later, whenever I turned it on, it would start autoclicking, and the only way to stop it is to remove the USB charger.

Cheap,1,"I bought this last year not wanting to pay for a premium mouse, and after seeing so many comments. Turns out it's a mistake. The mouse stops working after a few months when i work from home. The pointer just doesn't react at all only the scroll works. If it's a functional mouse it's actually quite well made and I like the design overall. My kid loves the color.

Unfortunately it barely works, I have tried for a year now to get it to different surfaces and different ways to try and make it function better but it’s extremely slow and very glitchy and ends up slowing you down so much more than just using whatever mouse pad is on the laptop. It’s extremely lightweight and made from cheap plastic, I was expecting that at least it would work but the lag time is so great that you’re better off not using it at all.",99,1.0,2022,07,July,12
Very very light,3,Skip it,2,4.0,2022,07,July,12
Perfect for school with a MacBook,6,I chose this mouse because it lit up like the rest of my accessories. However the lights are so dim they are barely noticeable.

Great for its price tag,5,"I enjoyed the look and watching this mouse light up, but that is essentially it. The battery storage on the mouse is super low, so you'll have to plug it in any way after about a half hour of use, maybe an hour if you turn off the rainbow LED light feature. The mouse's scroll wheel broke on me in a middle of a game, not any aggressive game, mind you, just a house decorating sim and I've hardly used it for the six or so months I've had it.To sum up: For a quick, cheap purchase, it looks great but isn't worth it in the long run, and I regret not buying a different mouse.",116,5.0,2022,07,July,11

Roller doesn’t work,3," Finally sleep mode works on this upgraded LED mouse, sleep mode is a must for a mouse because not every time you’ll remember to turn it off plus why bother turning it off while your going for a short break or so it does it for you to save battery.Note: sleep mode does work on color mode, the previous mouse wouldn’t sleep on color mode but this upgraded mouse surly does and wish it had Bluetooth it would be the perfect mouse!",82,1.0,2022,07,July,06

I threw away my money.I’ve tried syncing this mouse to multiple computers and devices, with the same results — nothing. I can’t find any info about the switch on the bottom, or how to troubleshoot, but when I plug the mouse in to charge it, it illuminates blue.

It broke already. Bought 3/2022,5,"The good - has a separate USB dongle that stores away, and charges internally, ie, no need for a battery.The bad - The mouse tracking is very erratic - too fast, too slow, and could not find a setting that suited me. But what renders it unusable for me is the click latency - I have to click multiple times on anything to get it to work, or I end up dragging something I don't mean to. Some people may also find this mouse a bit too small.YMMV - Up to one's taste how they like the changing colors on the mouse light display - either just red, or it switches colors. I wish you could turn it off though, which unfortunately you can't.",124,1.0,2022,07,July,06

I got it and it never even turned on. I made sure I was doing everything right and even got my dad to look too, but it wouldn’t charge.

Nice,1,"This mouse was OK when I first got it.  I have a USB C-port in my tablet and ordered a mouse for a C-port.  What I received was a mouse for a USB A port + an adapter.  Not a great solution as it sticks out from the tablet and tends to get hit by other objects plus an additional point of failure.  The mouse worked well for about 2 weeks and then died.  It would take a charge and show fully charged but then when turned on to either of the 2 on positions, the mouse would light up for 1-3 seconds and then die.

Small inexpensive rechargeable mouse,4,I purchased this mouse 6 weeks ago. I only get on my laptop literally a few hours per week. Suddenly the scroll stopped working. I uninstalled and reinstalled the mouse. There were no driver updates. I changed the number of lines for scrolling. Nothing fixed the issue.

Love it!,2, Pros:-Quiet-Smooth-No delays or lagging issues so far-Pretty colors (when not moving the mouse)Cons:-Seems a bit cheap-A little flatter than I'd like; doesn't fit naturally to my palm so it makes it uncomfortable-The red optical light shines through the other pretty colors when you're moving the mouse.  I want to see the various colors (even when moving the mouse)---not a red LED light shining through which is overpowering.-Some of the colors shine all throughout and for much longer while others barely show.The right side of the mouse (I'm right-handed) doesn't emit the colors as vividly as the left side (next to my thumb).  One small section is almost inoperative.I'll probably be returning it as I have bought another mouse that also changes colors and it doesn't emit the red LED like this one.  It was super cheap fortunately in case I keep it.  Who knows!  I guess you get what you pay for.,152,5.0,2022,06,June,02

Scroll stopped working,3,I am big on reviews & peoples honest opinions when it counts. As for style it’s a nice mouse but for the main purpose of the mouse it is not good. Even if it’s completely charged it will only work for about 10/15 minutes before it starts to freeze & then eventually go dead. It’s very frustrating & annoying especially if you work from home. I would of posted a pic but I am in the process of returning it & don’t feel like getting it.,86,2.0,2022,06,June,02
Roller issues,2,"I love the rotating colors on the mouse but it doesn't run by batteries. This seems pretty cool at first because you save money on having to buy double a's but then you have to think about remembering to charge it. If you've been using it all day non stop, it starts to die by the night time. Other than that i think it's super cute. and it's pretty good and accurate with pointing even on shiny surfaces I didn't have much of an issue.",85,2.0,2022,06,June,02

IT DID NOT WORK!!!,4,I just needed a wireless mouse for at work because I was sick of the cord the company issued mouse had.  The color is bright and the lights are a nice subtle change to working…they’re pretty.  The only thing I hate is that I have to bounce it on the mousepad to wake it up.  Nothing major but the sensor could be better.  It’s not overwhelmingly wonderful but it’s cute and is a good value considering the cost.,78,1.0,2022,06,June,01

Already annoyed as I wasn't looking to charge this all day to work for only work hours. I did turn it off after each use as well. The next day it worked for even less time.

The box being dirty I can understand due to shipping, but the mouse itself has lint, a few pieces of pet hair, and the track scroll is dirty as if it’s been used a lot. It was not described as used, but very much appears to be and I’m upset to pay full price for something that has definitely been out of the box.",77,4.0,2022,05,May,27
Nice,1,I bought this mouse for my Macbook and it would not even turn on! I charged it all day and it would not work or connect to my laptop. It just flashed a red color like the battery was dead and that was that happened. Save yourself some money and look for another mouse elsewhere. I should've just gone to best buy or target.,64,4.0,2022,05,May,27

Stopped working,2,I admit that I might have overused it since I bought it for my work from home.. BUT my sis got a similar one which is why I bought this one and THAT one actually lasts days without the need of a chargeI needed to charge this one multiple times on the day and at one point it just wouldn't work even while plugged in so I still needed to switch to the old oneIt is really disappointing idk if a got a faulty product or if that is actually the extent of its productivity,95,1.0,2022,05,May,27

Loud,1,I purchased gold they sent black. Tried to send it back but Amazon couldn’t afford gas so the place I needed to return it to was inconvenient so I kept it. Big mistake. I got it at end of April  and the scroll portion is already broken. A sham of mouse and company.,53,1.0,2022,05,May,25
LED wireless mouse.,3,I have purchased two of this product in the past year (one to replace the other). On both of the the scroll button stopped working. I dropped the first one and I understood why it stopped working. The second one I did not drop. It just quit working after 3 months. Cute and light weight but not long lasting enough for me.,62,5.0,2022,05,May,25
doesn't work very well,4,Function well at work still.,5,2.0,2022,05,May,24
Noisy Scroller,2,Horrible quality. The wheel stopped working only after a few hours. It is very light and feels very cheap.,19,2.0,2022,05,May,24
Did not like at all,5,"My first concern is that it does not give you a warning when it needs recharging, it just dies out, If you are using your USB for something else, you have to stop what you are doing to plug in the mouse.  Second, the charge does not last long. Very frustrating.  And now the most important - It Died!  Just stopped working.  Oh well, so much for fancy; I'm going back to battery operated mouse.",75,1.0,2022,05,May,24
Broke after 2 weeks of use,6,"The title of my post says a lot. I also like how lightweight it is. It’s very responsive to movement, but not overly so. It’s as good a wireless mouse as I’ve ever had.",34,2.0,2022,05,May,24
Dead after a couple months,5,"The mouse itself was wonderful! It installed within seconds and was very smooth operating. It fit well in my small hand and there was no clicking noise. I wish it worked out as I liked the mouse itself.The only issue is not the mouse itself, but my sensitivity to the LED/optical lights. I got a  migraine from it. The LED light can be turned off, so that in itself could be remedied. But the optical light which is a bright red showed through the side lights, the gap between the switches and the DPI option switch. There was no way of blocking the light. I was really sad I had to return it.",113,1.0,2022,05,May,24

Oh no….,2,"I work from home and I work 8-12 hours a day depending if I do overtime or not so I needed a mouse because my wireless mouse of 5 years was dying. Now, I got this mouse in hopes it would work great because of all the reviews. The first day I got this mouse it was very uncomfortable so right off the bat I knew I didn’t like flat mouses because it was cramping my hand. Second, the cursor was glitching. Unfortunately I cannot attach a video because it would be on company property and I don’t have a personal computer. I’ll have it on one side of the screen and automatically it will go to the other. If you like mouses like this and can deal with the glitching then that’s fine but for me I hated it. Very frustrating.",142,4.0,2022,05,May,24

Could Be Better But Not Bad For The Price,9,"Started off great, but the charge stopped working, couldn’t tell if it needing charging, one day it didn’t turn on, left it to charge while it was off and on 2 hours each way and it still wouldn’t hold a charge or turn on.

Great product,2,"The mouse seemed nice when I got it and has a great feel in your hand with quiet clicks. However, after 3 weeks of every other day use the scroll wheel stopped working. I returned it for a replacement and now, 3-4 weeks after receiving the replacement, that scroll wheel has also stopped working. Because the original purchase was outside the return window, a return was not possible. Would not buy again, and am going with a different product from a different seller/manufacturer.",83,5.0,2022,05,May,22

Didn't work for more than 2 days!,7,you dont hear any clicking like normal mouses which is nice. The color is good and smooth as well. My only complaint is you have to move it back and forth sometimes to wake it up. Rather than that its a perfect mouse when its awake.,46,1.0,2022,05,May,21
Easy Glider,2,"It seems to work fine so far.  The lights around the side are constantly red until well charged, but then they rotate.  Very easy to set up, but does not seem to work when wired.",35,5.0,2022,05,May,21

Like clicking a cloud,4,This mouse stops working even when fully charged and the light on the bottom is on. This did not start happening until 6 weeks after the return window ended. I would not recommend buying this for these reasons. It was a waste of money.,44,5.0,2022,05,May,20

Just right size and sound,5,The mouse arrived today. Easy to set up. So far it is working properly. I like the fact that it's rechargeable. No more AA battery to replace. I'll have to get use to its size. A lot shorter than my old Morosoft mouse. Hope it lasts as long as the old mouse. Time will tell.,55,5.0,2022,05,May,20

Just like photo,3,"I really liked the mouse at first, it matched perfectly and was very convenient. First thing i noticed was how plasticy it was, that didn't bother me tho. One day as i was using the mouse to scroll, the little scroll wheel fell into the mouse! i tried to fix it and i couldn't. I wasn't pressing hard on it and it always stayed on my desk. Its a cute mouse, love the look of it. But it is very cheaply made and will most likely break!",87,5.0,2022,05,May,19
Needs to be charged too frequently,6,"Not sure why this died after a couple months of use, but it is no longer working. Bummer because it was super cute and added to my office aesthetic.",29,3.0,2022,05,May,19

Had it 1 month now will not work at all,10,"Honestly it’s far less heavy than I would’ve liked. I don’t feel as though this will be adequate for long-term gaming but it’ll be alright for web surfing or writing. It’s also fairly small, then again I have pretty large hands. For the price, I couldn’t ask for much more, but I do think it’s important to inform people of its cons regardless of how cheap it is. Also, it DOES work with a macbook air despite the one star reviews. You have to connect the receiver to the adapter (it takes a good bit of force) and then plug it into the computer. I wish the instructions could’ve been more clear about that, but it’s whatever:",117,1.0,2022,05,May,19
Broken adapter,2,This mouse is just trash. It’s lifespan is 32 days. Stopped working just 2 days after the return window closed. I don’t recommend purchasing if you want something that is actually functional and long lasting. Getting tired of Amazon allowing vendors sell junk without recourse.,45,3.0,2022,05,May,19
Nice mouse,2,Didn’t realize that there wasn’t a place to put a battery in so it always had to be charged. After two or three weeks I could no longer charge it and could not have it work. Cheaply made would not recommend if you need it long-term or if you spend a lot of time on the computer,57,5.0,2022,05,May,18

"Died a Quick & Quiet Death, don't bother",8,I liked this mouse just fine.  I bought it to use at school with my chromebook.  It was fine until a couple weeks ago. I scrolled the mouse wheel and something broke. Now the wheel just spins and spins and does nothing.  I only used it a few times a week for meetings and such. I would buy a better one; don't bother with this one.,66,5.0,2022,05,May,18
Never worked,2,This mouse is great quality and duration is excellent. This mouse goes uncharged for 2 months while being a university student. I realize recently it have been giving a little problem. Hopefully the seller can assist with this. Great but otherwise,41,1.0,2022,05,May,18

Stop working after a few weeks??,6," Absolutely love it! And it is rechargeable, changes colors. The battery lasts forever.  5 stars",15,1.0,2022,05,May,17
Stopped working,2,The mouse itself is nice but the USBc part does not fit into my surface nor does the USB part fit.  I bought this because i have a new surface and needed a USBc to USB connection so i could use the mouse with the surface.  I guess the specs are different in China.i had to go back and buy a USBc so i could use the mouse.  Attached is a picture of the one i had to buy.Do not recommend unless you want a project.,86,1.0,2022,05,May,17

"Piece of trash, don’t buy!",5,"Just so you know, I loved the simple Amazon wireless mouse, but our cats kept knocking it off the table and the battery cover would come off. Over and over (stupid cats!) But now, with this mouse, the battery is rechargeable, the cats can't tear it apart, and it has cool lights on it. The function is good, the price was low, everything is solid--so, I recommend it.",68,1.0,2022,05,May,16
It was great until I clicked the middle Scrolling piece,10,I’ve only had this for a few months now and it is completely broken. The scroll feature lost its traction and no longer works. The battery life wasn’t great and it never worked flawlessly. I need a new mouse now 🥺,41,4.0,2022,05,May,16

The lights are pretty cool but there is an option to not have them on which is great to extend battery life. Holds a charge really well and will still work with the usb charger plugged in if necessary. I plugged in to 2 different computers and worked immediately on both. Seems quite reaponsive, but I only use it for general computer work so i dont know how it would work for gaming.

Great! Except one thing..,4,"The mouse came as described with the option I chose. However, after letting it charge for the recommended time before use, it would not connect to my computer.

Chromebook Incompatibility,2,"I tried to get my daughter a nice mouse for her Minecrafting and man, what a waste of $20 this mouse was x 2! It connected to its included dongle just fine, but I almost broke a nail taking the dongle out of the mouse body. If you don't have something slim to wedge in between the dongle and the mouse body, prepare for some ouchies. Do you like the rainbow effect? Well, I hope you also enjoy less than 1 day of battery life. Is your battery dead now? Welp, can't charge and use the mouse at the same time. Do you think it'd be nice to use a long, braided USB cord as a wire for this mouse? Nope, the Micro USB only supports charging...not data. Don't hate yourself? Don't get a budget mouse.If you want a good mouse for roughly $15 more, check out the Razer Basilisk X - it supports Bluetooth & USB, and it has excellent battery life. My son uses it every day for Minecraft/Roblox/YouTube and I purchased it at the end of January. It is now Mid-May and I've changed its single AA only once.

"After using for 2months, it stopped working!",7,"I have been using this with my work laptop, which I use 8-9 hours daily for remote work. I’ve had this for a few weeks and only needed to charge once since then. I really love the feel of it, it’s a near silent and very soft click sound when using buttons. I like the look of it and the lights, so I know when it’s in sleep mode. Turns on and immediately works with one click. Completely operational when plugged in to charge as well. The charge cord is very short but I plugged into the laptop to charge it and it was long enough for me to use it right next to the USB port it was plugged into without being a nuisance. I would love for there to be a way to see the battery life on the mouse, it’s the only thing I would change/add.Very pleased and hope it lasts a long while!Update:This mouse is still going strong, still love it. I use it daily for work, 8+ a day, 5 days a week. Still love the lights lol.My one and ONLY complaint - I wish we could see the battery life of the mouse. I have been charging one every couple of weeks just to be safe (I hate the laptop mouse). It does work when plugged in and charging, tho, so that is nice, I just prefer wireless.

Chintzy,1,"I made the mistake of reading the reviews only after I bought the mouse, because it had 4.5 stars with something like 30,000 reviews so I thought it was fine. I saw a few reviews that said the seller tried to bribe them into removing their review! That made me really regret buying from such an unethical business. I don't think you should buy this mouse even if you're on a budget - there's much better quality mice out there for even less money than this costs.This mouse is very cheaply made. As for performance issues:For one, it's way too thin and lightweight - When using it, it's very easy to knock it out of place and click something by mistake because it's not heavy enough (or grippy enough on the bottom) to stay where you put it. I've never had this issue with a mouse before. The tracking sensor is also way too sensitive - the cursor still moves when you lift the mouse a decent couple centimeters above the surface it's on. This also makes it very hard to put the cursor where you want it on the screen because it's still tracking movement when you lift it up.The cord to charge it is pretty short - although that's not a huge issue, just sort of disappointing. The biggest issue is that the cord does not seem to fit properly into the port on the mouse and takes a bit of manhandling. It felt like I was going to break some of the cheap, thin plastic when I first plugged it in.As for looks:The edges where the ""paint"" or whatever it is on the top are pretty rough, and it even came with some of the paint chipped off. I bought the light pink mouse. It's not nearly as light as it is in the pictures. It's darker and much warmer toned rather than a cool light pink like the picture. It's also not as reflective as the pictures show but that's not a huge deal. You can turn off the RGB lights by the switch on the bottom if you want, but it still emits a red light when using it. I wish it didn't do that - it's ugly and probably wastes more power.",378,2.0,2022,04,April,26

Worth it since it's cheap,5,"When I first got the item the color looked off. I ordered the Blue but I'm fairly positive based on the images I was sent Mint Green. I liked the quiet button clicks and it was nice to have in college classes for a bit because it was so quiet. However, after only a week and a half, the mouse wheel stopped working. I could feel the tension in the wheel was gone so I opened it to investigate and it looked like there was a small plastic rod that rotated with the wheel but the contact point between the rod and wheel was broken so it wouldn't work anymore. I liked the aesthetics of it except for the red led used for the tracking would also overpower the RGB lights. It bothered me but that didn't affect the function. I wish this had worked better.",146,4.0,2022,04,April,25

Mouse stopped working after 3 months.,6,Worked good for the first 2 months. Used the mouse on a security camera hard drive to review camera footage. Worked fine one time and after that no “cursor “ icon appeared. Tried plugging it back into my desktop and still no cursor icon available. It won’t select anything. Only right click works but can’t scroll to a selection. Luckily my desktop is touch screen so I manually opened up the drives properties and it’s said that All device functions are working properly. Clearly not being able to see a cursor is an issue 🥴,95,1.0,2022,04,April,24

I thought it would run out of power in a day or two but is still working nicely. The mouse feels comfortable under my palm, not too big or too small.

It holds a charge well and is great for in the go,12,"When I bought this mouse I loved it. It took me a few tries to get it paired right, but it is a game changer for my laptop. The rechargeable battery life on it is great. I found that if the mouse stopped responding quickly, that it was time to charge it.I purchased it late September and at the end of April my roller has stopped working randomly. It worked and then I went to use it an hour later and it no longer does. The scrolling wheel is an essential feature for me with my laptop. I'm disappointed.",99,5.0,2022,04,April,22

What You See is What You Get,7,I’ve gone through 3 or 4 of these in less than a year. They are not durable in my teenagers hands. I’m sure they are not the most gentle with them  either. I buy them because they are cheap and we just need to get through the school year. I have switched brands recently to see if it’s them or this brand that just breaks. It’s always the scrollers that break.,71,4.0,2022,04,April,21

It breaks easily,3,"This mouse works as advertised. The changing lights on the side of it are what drew me in when browsing for a new mouse on Amazon. I don't really like the slim feel to it, I feel like my hand would get tired after using it for extended periods of time. I also was looking for specifically a USB-C mouse, and to make this one work with USB C you have to use the included adapter, which ends up sticking out quite a ways on the edge of your computer. This is clearly stated in the advertisement, I just didn't pay enough attention when I bought the mouse.",108,1.0,2022,04,April,20
The mouse came with a scratched mark,7,"The price of this mouse was cheap, and you will get just that with this product. It serves its purpose OK. I like the color changing LED lights. But this mouse is too lightweight for my liking, and my hand is too big to fit on the mouse comfortably. It feels like there is a lag when moving the arrow, just an overall not great feel compared to my mouse on my work/office computer.",74,1.0,2022,04,April,20

Broke within a few months,5,"I like that this mouse os sleek in design has a long battery life, and is easy to set up. I often forget to turn it off but that doesn't matter because it goes into a sleep mode to preserve battery. The only concern My tablet has a C type so the converter is helpful. The only thing that I would change is that the converter doesn't fit inside the mouse for storage so you have to be careful not to lose it if you detach it from the tablet.",90,1.0,2022,04,April,19

Great until it breaks,4,"I have had this mouse for almost 2 months, and I use it at least 12 hours a day. I haven't been paying close enough attention to amount of hours until it needs charging, but in the time I have had it I have only had to charge it 3 times, and I was able to continue to use it while charging.I do use it for gaming, but my games don't require fast and accurate like RPG's etc..so I can say yes, it does gaming for me, but I'm unsure about speed games.Pros:*It's slim and long so it feels good in my hand even though it's not ""ergonomically"" built, and it fits nicely in my carry case.*The colors are soothing*You have options for either standard USB or USB-C for chargingThe Cons:*The on/off button is teeny weeny and sits flush with the hole. you need nails or a stylus to turn it on*The sensor underneath sometimes has issues with the mouse pad and it ""skates"" over the pad. A good shake usually gets it right.All in all, it's priced reasonably for what you get.**update: like everyone else, just a few days past the 30 day return cutoff my mouse also died.

Of course, you can turn off the pulsing colors to save charge, but who would want to??? Unless you needed to...Also, it's a bit small, good for travel, and fits a woman's hand.

Nope,1,"It was a nice, quiet mouse but about 6 months in, I've had issues charging with different and the original charging cord. The charge does not last very long either.

Smooth,1,"I have had 2 of these. The first mouse I ordered worked fine until the mouse just felt loose and didn’t respond. I was able to get a replacement and was satisfied.

Okay but.. .,3,"Normal daily use for a few weeks. Scroller suddenly caved in today and stopped working. Positive reviews must be from people who haven’t owned it for long, or mine was just damaged during shipping. Nevertheless, I honestly didn’t know computer mice could even break. Returning.",45,3.0,2022,04,April,05
Got a second one that was junk too,8,I bought this for working at home/general use. I was sick of my old mouse running out of batteries when I didn't have any. Works great for general use and battery lasts a while but I haven't done any button mashing games with it. My only complaint is the USB remote plugin fits tight into the underside for storage. You have to dig with your nail to remove it. Small infrequent task but for me if it was corrected its an ideal computer mouse.,84,1.0,2022,04,April,05
Works great,2,"Really liked this mouse for the first week. It then became pretty useless. Tried to recharge, reinstall and all the other hacks. Still won’t accurately track worth beans. Off to the donation pile. Can’t recommend",35,5.0,2022,04,April,05

So cute!,2,"Okay, so, I cannot answer honestly about the gaming capabilities of this mouse. My husband is the gamer. I can however, let you know about my general usage opinion...First off, it's pretty. I love the color and I love that it lights up on the sides. There is a setting on the back that allows you to turn off the lights to save battery drain. I've been using it for 4 days, pretty consistently and haven't needed to charge it.There wasn't any software or drivers that needed to be installed in order for it to be used. I just plugged in the small USB and it immediately worked.That's all I can say at this point since I haven't had it that long. I will update this review in a few months and include any issues I may experience and any new opinions I develop...",144,5.0,2022,04,April,05
Worst Mouse Ever,3,"I bought this on October 29, 2021 and it stopped working on April 6, 2022. It started acting up on the 5th where the responsiveness was sketchy. I charged it that night and the next day it didn’t power up.",40,1.0,2022,04,April,05

"Cheap quality, not like photos",5," If you have big hands, I don’t recommend you buying this. Also with the lighting I really dislike it!

Overall, it’s a good and sturdy mouse, just thought they could’ve worked on the exterior more.",57,1.0,2022,04,April,05
Okay u get what u pay for,7,"I'm a teacher so I don't want to be attached to my computer at the front the whole day. This mouse keeps a good charge, allows me to walk around my class the whole time- stays attached to me, & the colors just add a bit of fun to it.",50,5.0,2022,04,April,05
Don’t forget to turn off when not using,8,I really like this mouse. It's perfect size and I love that it charges. Holds the charge for a long time.,21,5.0,2022,04,April,04
Never Worked😩,2,"It is exactly as depicted.  My old mouse just wasn't working correctly, even with a new battery, I was banging on it to get it to respond.  This one is just as advertised, changes colors and responds on just a slight touch.  I LOVE IT !",46,1.0,2022,04,April,04

Colorful paperweight.,2,"I loved this mouse--it is super lightweight and the color is lovely. Sometimes I would forget to charge it after a week/week and a half, so that was on me to try to remember. But just yesterday, it stopped charging. Usually the light turns blue when it's charging, which is a great indicator, so I left it overnight to charge while plugged into my laptop. This morning when I tried to use the mouse, it didn't work. I thought maybe I hadn't plugged it in properly, but just now when I plugged it in (tested out several different USB ports on my laptop), the blue charging indicator light flickered for a second and then went out. It seems that this mouse is not charging anymore, making it basically useless. :(",130,1.0,2022,04,April,02

Functional and long battery life,5,"I like the feel and look of this mouse. I bought it as a deal of the day. I really like how it changes colors and how smooth it feels. I also love that you can recharge it. Only dislike is that I review and edit important documents for work and sometimes the cursor would move unexpectedly and will cause me to type something I wasn't trying to type. I'll have to  undo whatever I did. Other than that, good price and quality!",83,5.0,2022,04,April,02
Wow! What a mouse! Great quality at value price!,9,"This mouse worked just long enough for me not to be able to return it.  Not sure what went wrong, but it just gave out and that was it.",29,5.0,2022,04,April,02

Worthless,1,Nunca funciono,2,1.0,2022,04,April,01
No good,2,"Loved at first. Very cute, loved the scrolling and clicking. Bought for work and used for a couple of weeks and noticed my thumb hurting a lot. Felt like I pulled something in it. Noticed it was worse when using the mouse. Switched to my old mouse that is ergonomic and my thumb is improving. If it’s for minimal use it’s probably ok, but definitely not for daily use at the office",72,1.0,2022,04,April,01
Makes a squeaky noise( very very annoying),7,"This is for doing school work and casual browsing. Being a gamer, I wouldn't use this for gaming for anyone who is asking, but as a standard wireless mouse it works great with no concerns as of yet. I like that you don't have to replace disposable batteries and it charges quickly via a charging cable that comes with the mouse, as well as instructions (you won't need them as it's very simple to figure it all out). The color changing lights are a nice touch that my 9 year old loves. Would strongly recommend, especially for the price. I enjoy the product so far, especially for school work and internet browsing.",112,2.0,2022,04,April,01
It's sad a nice item but packaged had no packing material I don't know if it it damaged,18,"I use this mouse for my laptop only when I travel.

Already the roller wheel stopped,5,I bought this to use at work as they only provided a wired mouse. I charged it before taking it in and it's been 2 weeks now and I haven't had to recharge it yet. It fits comfortably into my hand and is lightweight.,44,1.0,2022,03,March,15
Missing USB-C adapter,3,"As with several other reviews here, the one I purchased lasted several months, until it just stopped tracking mid-swipe.  I thought maybe it just needed a recharge, as that's what it has done in the past when I forgot to charge it overnight... but no, it's more like it just shorted out... works for a swipe and a click and then stops again. Kinda sucks because it's a really cool and fun mouse with the LED lights and the charging vs. batteries. I guess I'll look now to see if the warranty will help a girl out...",97,1.0,2022,03,March,31
Great mouse,2,"I have only used this a shirt time, it's alright, it does take a minute to get used to the low profile.  My biggest complaint is that it didn't come with a charger as stated.  I now have to find a charger that will fit, or spend more money to purchase a charger just to ensure I can recharge it.",60,4.0,2022,03,March,31

Sleek mouse that doesn't work.,5,"Unfortunately I missed the return window by less than a month - I do a lot of panning around for my work with the middle scroll wheel button, and the button has issues about half the time where it doesn't register that I clicked or gets stuck.

Worst mouse I've ever purchased.",60,2.0,2022,03,March,29
Lasts about a month.,4,"The fact that it has a quiet mechanism -no sound whatsoever during clicking- was great. But even though I only used it for my desktop computer at work (4-5 days a week), it is not working right now! I did not carry it around or used it for more than a hour during each day, basically because I use my laptop most of time. 10 months is a pretty premature time frame to not function.",75,1.0,2022,03,March,29

Pretty but not worth it,5,I really like this mouse.  It works great and is really cool looking.  I love the alternating color lights around it and since it's rechargeable you don't have to worry about a short battery life.  I work on my computer 40+ hours a week and I find I only need to charge it every 2-3 weeks.

Mouse speaks for itself,4,I have held back writing a review on this mouse based on some of the comments that it would die on them or it became unreliable after a while.

Every time I go to use the mouse throughout the day I have to return it on even when it’s already in the on position.

The lights on it still work almost 2 months later with no issue the charge on the mouse plugs into a standard Micro USB cord and the mouse will hold charge with daily use for about 3-5 days. I usually just end the evening plugging in to a micro usb port and I am always good to go. grat buy and will replace with the same when the time comes.,103,4.0,2022,03,March,22
"Dead Battery, Dead Mouse in less than 30 days",9,"nice size, fits the palm very nicely.  LED lightshow superfluous but i can live with it.  my old mouse went to mouseville, you know...the one down in tallahassee, FL !  LOL.  nice mouse for the buck.  could do worse.",39,1.0,2022,03,March,22

Good mouse,2,Worked good at first. Now after only very little use in two months time it won't take a charge. I would definitely stay away fro.this product,26,5.0,2022,03,March,21

"Great deal, works great",4,mouse wheel randomly broke 2 months after purchasing mouse...pretty disappointed in this....,12,4.0,2022,03,March,21
Great until it quit after a few months,8,This mouse worked for a day and then stopped. It was very comfortable to use and silent click which was nice. But it stopped working so it’s pointless.,28,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Only worked 4 months,4,"It's cute looking, comfortable. Except short uncomfortable charging cord (just use battery!), it was great.And then broke after 2 weeks. Just stopped.",22,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Very disappointed!!,2,"This is made with low quality. The adapter for USB-C doesn’t work, as in it doesn’t even fit into a USB-C port (I tried multiple to make sure this was the common denominator). The mouse comes apart too easily. The battery life is poor. Do not waste your money buying.",50,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Lags so bad I can't even use it,8,"Buy Buy Buy IT!!!!!!!!Its so quiet, so soft and so comfortable. Its easy to travel with and connectivity is great. Battery life is amazing!",24,1.0,2022,03,March,21

Works great with my laptop,5,Randomly turns off/dies after a short period of time,9,5.0,2022,03,March,21
Stopped working after 10 days,5,Works on my 2022 MacBook Air. Battery life is really good and the mouse feels good and clicks are very satisfying. Only downside is the adaptor is big and ugly.,30,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Not worth the money,4,This mouse was delivered missing 1 of the track strips on the bottom of the mouse. I decided to use it anyways since that shouldn’t impact the function. It worked for a few days and then started having problems. I have to click several times before I can get a response from it. It also barely holds a charge.,59,1.0,2022,03,March,21
Lifesaver!,1,It really lives up to the silent clicking making it comfortable in a way. The batter also seems to last quite a few days if you turn it off when it’s not in use. It also has various light patterns when you click the button in the middle. The silent clicking is what really gets me.,56,5.0,2022,03,March,21
Super cute & easy to use,6,Already stopped working exactly after the return window closed.,9,4.0,2022,03,March,21

Love it,2,I really loved the size and feel as well as how quiet it was. But it only lasted about 8 months before it completely crapped out and never worked again. I suppose it’s a good short term solution.,38,5.0,2022,03,March,21
A perfect fit,3,"It's size is perfect for both travel and for my hands. The LED is a great feature and works just as well as the wired one for my PC. I even bought my mother one, and she loves it too.",40,5.0,2022,03,March,21
slim,1,This mouse stopped working not even 3 weeks after I started using it. Not worth it.,16,4.0,2022,03,March,21
Loved it until is stopped working,6,"Love this mouse! It’s very smooth and the battery life last pretty long. The led lights are bright but not too distracting if u like to game in the dark like i do. I ended up losing the small piece that goes plugs into my computer tho i wish i could just order that piece. Also if the charger was a bit longer that would be better, i hate trying to use the mouse while plugged in charging it has no range. Other than that it’s a good buy",89,2.0,2022,03,March,20
Smooth and easy to use.,5,I charged it. It still will not work. The mouse still will not work.,14,5.0,2022,03,March,20

Charge lasts!,2,"This product works intermittently. I’ve made sure to charge it, and even with a full charge, it won’t click every time when I try to do so or it will get stuck with and without a mouse pad.",38,5.0,2022,03,March,20

Not worth the money,4,"I love this little mouse! Very well built and sturdy (dropped it twice and nothing happened to it), the colors do not fade, fun lighting, reliable, and very long charging/battery life! I use it almost every day, and haven’t had to charge it in weeks! I ended up buying another one for my daughter, and it’s just as well made!",60,2.0,2022,03,March,19
Long-lasting charge,2,I bought 5 months ago and it stopped working. It’s cheap. I suggest not buying this.,16,5.0,2022,03,March,19
Cute addition,2,It's nice looking and the wife absolutely loves it and it's vibrant colors. I got her the mint green one and it works like a champ. I didn't like the feel of a big flat mouse under my hand but she said that it isn't a problem and likes it so that's the important thing.,55,5.0,2022,03,March,18
Broke in less than 2 months,6,Worked great for about 2 weeks and then the battery kept dying faster and faster.  Now it cannot even hold a charge.  So it now rests in the garbage can.,30,2.0,2022,03,March,18
It came clean,3,"Really liked the look/feel/quiet click, but it broke on me after a few days!",14,5.0,2022,03,March,18

"Terrible, Do Not Buy",4,"Bought to replace older belkin that had no wheel.  I'm trying to learn cad so the wheel is necessary... this Mouse is amazing, i can't believe the cost.  My girlfriend stole it to take to work so I'm ordering another one... very impressed.",43,1.0,2022,03,March,17

usb broke,2,It was ok while it worked. Prefer battery to having to charge it via USB. Only worked 4 months and the roller mechanism broke.,24,3.0,2022,03,March,17
Ok,1,I  LOVED this mouse until the scroll wheel broke a week after the return window. Very disappointed!!,17,5.0,2022,03,March,17
It would never charge,4,I have had this mouse for a while and I have barely used it because the lag is so bad. SO SO SO SO SO BAD. It doesn't follow. It's so slow. It's infuriating. I do graphic work and cannot have a mouse that doesn't act in real time. I do not recommend.,53,2.0,2022,03,March,17
Scroll wheel broke after 6 weeks,6,It broke within 2 days from  falling off a laptop onto table. I've had other computer mice that fell down the same distance all the way up to down the stairs at worknever had an issue do not reccomend,39,1.0,2022,03,March,17
Worked great for 6 weeks then died,7,"I bought this because it was rechargeable and for the ergonomic design. After using it for awhile, I plugged it in a charged it. Worked for awhile, then it would only work for a few hours, then not at all. When I plugged it in, I noticed that I had to move the connection (where it plugs into the device) to the left, then it would light up, but if I let go, nothing.  I would not recommend this product!",80,1.0,2022,03,March,17
Perfect,1,I really love this little mouse as it is easy to use and I can put it in a safe mode so I don't have to keep recharging it and saving on having to buy batteries. My laptop is used primarily for embroidery files so I don't use it for gaming and can't address that.,55,5.0,2022,03,March,16
"I love the feel and look, but too bad the weel broke and I can't return",16,"I just used this mouse for work a few hours a day and it inexplicably stopped turning on when I flipped the switch after just 10 days. I plugged it in to charge like I'd done a few times before and the blue light came on. When the blue light went off I unplugged it and switched it on, but it flashed red a couple of times and wouldn't work. I repeated the process with the same outcome. I know it's a cheap mouse but wow, I got less than one day of use for every dollar I spent.",99,2.0,2022,03,March,16

Simply and easy to use,5,Absolutely loved this mouse. But it stopped working all of the sudden. After reading reviews it seems several others had the same issue. But I guess that's what you get when you purchase something that is only $14. 🤷‍♀️😞,39,3.0,2022,03,March,16
Love this mouse. It moves easy and love the texture feel. The lights are awesome,15,It’s very comfortable to use. Minimal noise,7,5.0,2022,03,March,16
Wasted money,2,The mouse is exactly as it appeared. I love the lightness and design. I didn't feel aggrevating symptoms of my carpel tunnel as quickly after use. This enabled me to work longer.,32,1.0,2022,03,March,16

Doesn't stay charged very long,5,The mouse is sleek and cool looking especially with the the colors.  But after a few months. It won't hold charge and the input for the charge cable is loose nd won't try charge unless it held in a certain angle nd pushed it with force,46,1.0,2022,03,March,15
Awesome product,2,"I got tired of using my laptop keyboard and decided rj invest. I love the led colors with the mouse although I rarely change the settings. I love that I don’t have to switch batteries and all I have to do plug it in. I could tell after about a week including me leaving my mouse on a few times that it was time for a charge. My mouse began to lag and I went ahead and plugged it up. Also, the color of the mouse matches with the picture well",91,5.0,2022,03,March,15

Broke after 5 months,4,"It works okay in the first couple of minutes, and then the cursor starts to jump other than moving smoothly as the mouse moves. Also, clicks often fail to work at the first button down. Sometimes several clicks need to trigger an action. I threw it away and ordered other products.",51,1.0,2022,03,March,14
Non gamer,2,The charge does not last a full day,8,5.0,2022,03,March,14
Make sure you buy the adapter for Apple Mac,9,"Well I thought it would be clever to buy two of these and rotate them. However not only do they not maintain a charge WHILE TURNED OFF (I literally have to charge both after one dies, and it's not like these things last that long, so that's pathetic). But also when fully charged and following the troubleshooting, the mouse still will just flash red and not work.I got a 3rd to replace the 2nd, but that one was just as bad. They are all bad. This is a waste of money. You're better off dealing with batteries than these cheap, wasteful electronic items that will just end up in the landfill anyway. Please don't buy, because you will be happy with it right until...the return window closes.",127,1.0,2022,03,March,14

Unfortunately I liked it so well this was the second one that I ordered and the first one that I ordered the rollerball stopped working but it’s too late to return that one so now I have two broken ones.

Good little mousey,3,"When I bought this mouse, I really liked it. It felt nice, worked well on a consistent basis, and the colors give my desk a pretty touch. It was cheap so I guess you can't expect it to last but I was hoping to get at least a year. After 9 months of light daily use, it doesn't want to charge. Even if I leave it plugged in all night, in the morning it barely has any charge. This is a decent mouse if you don't mind having to buy a new one a couple of times a year but I'm going to just spend a little more and get one that is, hopefully, better quality.",116,5.0,2022,03,March,10

Great,1,So I have had this mouse for about 4 weeks and It works perfectly I never encountered the problems people had with it stopping and people say that the battery dies too quickly which I have been using on the same battery without charging it for 3 days. My cursor has also never messed up it works just fine. The only problem I have with this device is the lighting is not nearly as impressive as I thought it would be but I guess that's what you get for buying a mouse for 11$,94,5.0,2022,03,March,07

Until this day, as I am writing this review I haven't recharge it not once. I must say I use it a fair amount of time, not to full extent everday but i do use it.

"Its cute, not practical",4," This product is not worth the headache. The first mouse stopped scrolling after 2 weeks of use. I returned it and 2 days after using the new mouse I am returning it and requesting a refund.  The mouse doesn't hold a charge because there is a red light around the whole mouse that is always on, EVEN WHEN SWITCHED OFF. The previous mouse wasn't like this and worked well until it stopped scrolling. Now I have to go to a second location to return the mouse again. They should reimburse the gas I've used returning this mouse. I probably spent more in gas than what I paid for the mouse.As you can see in the video, it is off but the light is on. I turn it off and the light on. I then turn it off again and the light doesn't turn off.",144,2.0,2022,03,March,04

Just Right,2,"The battery doesn’t even last one day! I pretty much have to keep it plugged in at all times and I have the light setting turned off.

Poor battery life. Need to. Charge  daily,7,"After receiving this mouse, I charged the mouse per the instructions on a normal rate USB charger (non fast charger). This took a little under two hours for a full charge. The blue light goes out when fully charged.I installed the USB receiver into my computer and the mouse was recognized immediately on Windows 11. The mouse seems to work smoothly, and the mouse pointer is swift. You can adjust pointer speeds if it is too fast. The mouse lights up around the sides when in use, it is a bit quirky but it doesn't bother me. Also the mouse will go to sleep if not used for a certain period of time, probably to prolong the battery charge. To wake the mouse I just move it or press a button.Overall it is a decent wireless/rechargeable mouse.",137,3.0,2022,03,March,01

Scroll Wheel Broke 3 Days After Return Window Closed,9,"I really wanted to love this mouse, but it is TERRIBLE. The scroll hardly works, and yes I tried multiple mousepads.

It was perfect.  4 days later IT'S DEAD!!!,19,"I bought this because I’m trying to minimize the amount of wires on my desk and because the color matches my pc case but it’s not worth it. The mouse barely works and it takes forever to get it to actually click on what you want, like it’s pretty and the colors are cute but those are the only good things about this. Thankfully I play with a controller so it doesn’t hinder my gaming but if you do play mouse and keyboard absolutely don’t get this.",87,1.0,2022,02,February,24
Love it,2, Its really great I don't use it for gaming if you are looking for that review stop here but for other review keeping reading. It changes color on its own you can't personally change it that's a bummer. It slowly changes color one thing that bothers me is the default red light. When you move it the red light appears and it over powers the other changing colors. If your fine with the red light then buy it. Other than that it does its job really pretty too. The mouse is a matte black so its not shiny just wanted to mention that.,103,5.0,2022,02,February,24

Within a week…,3,"I knew what I was getting myself into reading the bad reviews; it stops working in a few weeks. Usually, I hedge my bets especially when a product has so many reviews that end up with a 4.5 star rating. Alas, I lost this bet. The scroll function, a key feature I look for in buying mice, stopped responding after a a few weeks. A fluke? I should buy a scratcher if so because I bought two, one white, one black, and they both failed around the same time.I’m wondering if this is actually engineered to perform this way, though, as I’m seeing many other reviews doing the same thing, but people being bribed for a 5 star, if replaced. Quite genius, actually. If you get angry customers to review, it promotes product engagement, but then the rating can be manipulated by replacing the cheap product and soliciting a 4-5 star review. If this indeed is the case, BRAVO. Brilliant way to get as many positive reviews for a subpar product.",171,2.0,2022,02,February,23
So Far So Good,4,Scroll wheel broke after one day. Only used for less than an hour and it no longer scrolls and isn’t connected in the correct position anymore. Very light use.

Amazing,1,"I absolutely love this mouse.  First off I have to say my cat has knocked this done off the table multiple times and it still works.  That is huge with me.  Next it's a very nice mouse.

I figured the first one was a lemon so got a replacement but same issue.  No idea why but just works for like a week and then dies.",46,2.0,2022,02,February,17
Poor quality. Does not hold charge.,6, Haven’t had this mouse for more than a week and the left click is already broken. It won’t snap back into place. I loved the mouse in the beginning which made me order a replacement. Hopefully this one doesn’t let me down.,42,1.0,2022,02,February,17
No clicking sound!,3,"Now that I'm an old man and don't need anything super fancy for my desktop, I replaced a Deathadder from 2010 with it.  Only been using it for about 10 hours, but no major complaints so far.  Takes a little bit of getting use to because it's sits so low, but the clicks feel nice and seems fairly responsive.",59,4.0,2022,02,February,17
Horrible.,1,Really smooth soft click I liked 👍,7,1.0,2022,02,February,17

Great mouse,2,For the price I realized I could have gotten something a lot better. It’s cheaply made. Glitches even with a full charge. I got the white one and I wish I would have read the reviews before hand because it does indeed show the whole internal lighting unit which just adds the the cheapness of it. It does the job still all considering I just think it’s value is overestimated.,70,5.0,2022,02,February,16
Don't waste your money,4,Scrolling wheel went lose (broke) less than a week after purchase.,11,1.0,2022,02,February,16

Defective,1,Love this mouse works great and great price,8,1.0,2022,02,February,16
Bad connection,2,I love this mouse. I love the led colored lights the most. Another one of my favorite is that it is magnetic and sticks to my laptop when I’m in the car or at the local coffee shop.,38,1.0,2022,02,February,16
Long battery life,3,I fell in love with the color changing of this product but it kept cutting off and sticking. I had to return it,23,5.0,2022,02,February,16
Scroll wheel is bad,4,Love the feel of it with my hand and the fact it doesn't need to be charged every week.  I went over a week and a half before I had to charge it.,33,2.0,2022,02,February,15

"Hate to leave a bad review, I liked it",9,This item did not work from the very beginning. I sent it back. Will not purchase from this company again.,20,1.0,2022,02,February,15
Used for 1 day now won’t charge,7,"I needed a mouse for my laptop and so I bought this! The set up was really easy. Simply charge the mouse, plug in the USB and done! The silent clicks are indeed quiet but I wouldn’t say they’re completely inaudible, but that’s totally okay with me! When the mouse charges, it turns blue and when it’s done charging, the light will switch off. When I turn on the mouse to the color mode, the colors fade nicely to the next. The only nitpick for me is that I wish the white part of the top of the mouse was more opaque so that the backlit colors don’t peek through it. But it’s personal preference. I also like how it came with a USB to USBC adapter just in case it needs to be used for a Mac. Overall, a great mouse!",142,1.0,2022,02,February,15
Only worked 2 months,4,"Works really well, plus it looks nice! Great price, too!",10,1.0,2022,02,February,15

Dead in only three months,5,"Never buy this product!!!When I buy something, I usually look at product reviews, but this product seems to have a lot of problems, unlike reviews. I don't usually post reviews, but I'm posting this product review in hopes that there won't be victims like me. I bought a mouse and it worked fine at first. But after charging it, it started to get weird and didn't work at all. So I thought there might be a small problem, so I exchanged the new one instead of a refund. Received a new mouse and it worked fine for another few days. But after charging it again, it didn't work. The product user manual says it is sensitive to charging, but this is a serious problem. I bought this product for the convenience of not using the battery or wire, but I think it makes no sense to not work because of the charging prolem.",153,1.0,2022,02,February,13
Buyer’s Beware!!!,2,I bought this for my nephew and unfortunately he told me that its just all over the place on his chromebook screen..doesn't go where you need it to go etc,30,1.0,2022,02,February,13

Very cheap product.,3,"I recently got a job working from home and needed a mouse to accompany. I purchased the rose gold, it is beautiful, came on time, and hooked up with no issues. If you want to use the color changing lights, make sure to flip the switch on the bottom of the mouse all the way to the sunshine symbol, took me a few to figure that out, but otherwise great product!!",71,1.0,2022,02,February,12
Quiet clicks,2,It's quiet and cute. I love all the colors and the battery last a long time,16,5.0,2022,02,February,12
Can't get this to work with macbook pro,8,Battery life has been great so far. It goes to sleep mode when not in use but there’s also on/off function. I love that you can charge it also - I just plug it in once every few days overnight.,40,1.0,2022,02,February,12
Not compatible with Mac,4,"Bought this twice because it matched my keyboard, both times it broke within a month.I used it lightly throughout the day too",22,1.0,2022,02,February,12

Poor quality,2,"Love it. Came with the mouse itself , white cable , black usbc adapter . The white little adapter underneath the mouse easily connected to the  black usb that I used for my MacBook to usbc . The white small cable I believe to charge it. You can easily turn off the lights but they look really nice on. mouse is thin but comfortable! Although I order the silver to match my laptop it is not the exact same but close just a bit darker.",85,2.0,2022,02,February,12

Does the job,3,got it broken. The scroll works but nothing else works. Asked to get a new mouse but I have to go somewhere to return it which I don’t have time for.,31,5.0,2022,02,February,12
So cute,2,"I loved this mouse...for the literal two weeks (14 days) that I had it and it was working.  For no apparent reason, the scroll wheel just suddenly stopped working, approximately five seconds after I had last used it.  I had not subjected it to  any pressure, or abuse of any sort.  I was looking at a document, scrolled down, continued reading, tried to scroll down and...nope.  In the lower ratings, this seems to be a common problem.  I'm bummed, I really did love the mouse. :(",86,5.0,2022,02,February,10
Would buy again!,3,It is really great. It don't need charge for days then finally dead on me. I love it. Really cute and colorful. I use lots. I use with my MacBook Pro.,31,5.0,2022,02,February,03

Mouse cursor jumps around,4,"The wireless mouse worked well in the begining. It was small but it fit in my hand well and the lights were a nice, though not necessary, feature. I received it in September. It wasnt something I used every day, about once or twice a week. In February the scroll wheel just broke. It spins loosely and no longer scrolls on the screen. I do not use it often and I am definitely not rough on it.  I am dissapointed in the quality of this product.",86,2.0,2022,02,February,10
Disappointed,1,"The mouse looks great, feels great, but I didn't get more than a few hours out of it before it died.  I left it plugged in for several hours but it doesn't stay on anymore.  Despite several recharge attempts, it just doesn't turn on anymore.",45,3.0,2022,02,February,10
Disappointed,1,"This was a good mouse I got as a gift and I really liked it until it didn’t work anymore! After a while it stoped working and I looked at some other reviews that said they got a defective one, well I guess I did and they are kinda common to be defective so I would only risk buying it if you want the mouse a decent amount. I would say you’re chance of it being broken is like a 3/10. Also, it only stops working after like 4/5 days so you won’t know until then if you buy it…  Also I did like that they added a usb-c adapter in the box. I use they adapter for something else now.",121,2.0,2022,02,February,10
never worked,2,To slow. Don’t buy,4,1.0,2022,02,February,09
Works great for my laptop,5,"Nice mouse, the battery lasts along time before needing recharged and I like that I do not have to use a mousepad with it as it works great even without one.",31,5.0,2022,02,February,09
Great,1,The color and shape are very nice but the mouse and the packaging arrived very dirty. The scroll wheel on the mouse is made from a cheap rubbery/silicone material and is completely crooked. It also did not have a good feel when testing it out - not smooth and feels like it take a lot of extra pressure to operate than others. Not sure if this is due to it being crooked or not but either way this will be returned.,81,5.0,2022,02,February,09
Doesn't last,2,The wheel was broken the second day I used it,10,2.0,2022,02,February,09

I did not get the mouse.,6,"I really liked this mouse, but I had to return the first one because the wheel quite scrolling after it was knocked off my bed onto a carpeted soft bedroom floor. No big deal, they sent me a new one and I sent the malfunctioning one back. Well, the wheel has quit on this 2nd one too, once bitten and twice shy and all that.  I'll be returning this one as well & then be off to find a wireless mouse that's not so 'sensitive' and will last longer than a month. It really sinks, I liked this mouse a lot.",101,1.0,2022,02,February,09
Colorful!,1,I purchased this back in October but didn’t open it until 02/14 when my new computer finally came in. I used it for one day and it worked great and now won’t charge at all or even turn on when plugged in. Instructions say you can use it while charging but won’t even do that.

Inconsistent,1,"Really like the quietness of the clicks.  Flatter than most mice; took a little bit of getting used to but fine now.  Will be easy to travel with.  Very responsive.  Charges by USB and lasts for several days; no need to have extra batteries.  LED lights are fun, but hard to see in bright light.  I'm looking at the screen when I'm using the mouse (who doesn't?) so I don't really see the lights that much.",76,1.0,2022,02,February,07

Great inexpensive mouse,3,"This mouse has met all of my requirements. When my old wireless mouse began to die, I opted for this rechargeable one because I was sick of batteries. This has a very long battery life, as I use it for up to 8 hours in a row.

Defective,1,"I bought this product in November, by December the axle for the mouse wheel had snapped. I’ll admit I liked the size and look of it enough to buy it again….here we are in February and the same exact thing has happened again. I used this mouse for my work computer in the office, and certainly don’t aggressively use the scroll wheel. Yet the same axle has snapped on two of these units, both within the first 6 weeks of use. I’ve never had a mouse break apart like this before, so I have to conclude that this is just utterly cheap in the way it is made and the parts holding it together. I suppose you get what you pay for, a shame because aesthetically it is very nice.I will never buy this product again, I would advise anyone else to save your money and stay away. Pay a few extra dollars and find something that lasts more than a few weeks.Side note: I look forward to having the seller reach out to me to take down my review (rolls eyes).

He says the feel of it is off and it does not stay connected.,66,4.0,2022,02,February,02
Does not work,3,"You can't really beat the price, it's actually a little nicer than I was anticipating given what I paid. I would say it's worth the price, I just this with my chromebook for my online classes. The light is really cute too.",42,1.0,2022,02,February,02

Great Mouse for the price,5,"I originally bought this mouse for my gaming PC and it works great it's smooth and easy to use without a wire. I would also recommend people get a pretty big mouse pad so you have room to move, it makes everything better",43,4.0,2022,02,February,02
Updated Review,2,I purchased this mouse for my new MacBook Pro. It is so much better than the Apple Magic Mouse I was using with my iMac. This mouse fits perfectly in my hand and is easy to maneuver. The adapter for the USB-C port on my Mac works and fits perfectly. I am extremely happy with my purchase. The mouse also is rechargeable which will save me money as I will not be purchasing AAA batteries anymore!I highly recommend this product. The quality and appearance of this mouse make it seem like a much more expensive product! 5 stars!!!!,98,5.0,2022,02,February,02

PRODUCT SUCKS,2,"I would have loved this product if my hands weren’t so picky, and plus it was a bit too flat for gaming on a pc. Works fine very silent clicks, still if you aren’t used to a flat mouse don’t buy it",42,1.0,2022,01,January,31
Bad item,2,I liked the unit until it stopped functioning.,8,1.0,2022,01,January,31
LED wireless mouse,3,"PROS- wireless ease of use- feels nice: soft, smooth, sleek- dampened click, quietCONS**- It has a very loud scroll button - the wheel works fine, but the button is difficult to press down and is quite loud, so it slightly defeats the purpose of a quiet mouse.- no additional buttons such as ""back"" or ""forward""ADDITIONAL- you have to charge the mouse with the included USB charger",66,5.0,2022,01,January,31

Great mouse for the price,5,"Had it for only one day until I accidentally dropped it from less than a meter, and the stroller wheel broke.

Great product,2,The first mouse lasted 2 months and bought the same mouse to replace it.  It died within a day of using it.  Buy cheap - get cheap.  Not worth trying to have it replaced so am sending it back for a refund.  The first one worked great and had a satisfying button click... a shame it didn't last very long.,60,5.0,2022,01,January,29

Not working,2,After looking at the reviews of this particular LED mouse I decided to give it a try. I received it and so far I am very pleased with how it performs. It is extremely lightweight and the LED lights make it so much more enjoyable to use. Highly recommended!,49,1.0,2022,01,January,28

Mouse moves smoothly!,3,"I bought this mouse to throw in my laptop bag for those times when the trackpad was too much of a pain to use.  The mouse is slightly small in my hand, but is still comfortable and tracks well.  I really appreciate that it charges from a Micro USB cable. Great value for the price.",55,5.0,2022,01,January,25
Great,1,"I had to update my review because I initially gave it only one star. It abruptly stopped working after 2 months BUT I realized the following day that it was actually a problem with my Mac or WiFi instead of the mouse. When I attempted to print, my Mac was also not “finding” my printer. Ooops. So, I shut down my Mac, my printer, my WiFi and when I turned everything back on, all was well. Not sure which thing caused the problem, but happily, my mouse is working fine again. No one contacted me to change my review. I was not offered anything. As a business owner, I understand how important reviews are, so when something turns out differently… we need to update our review. It’s the right thing to do.",132,5.0,2022,01,January,25

Constant issues,2," I needed a new cheap mouse (and this was on sale) and read through a lot of reviews. I saw a lot of reviews stating that there was a chance that the white version could potentially not be solid white, allowing for the lights to show through the mouse through the top. Well, that sounded cool to me, so I ordered white hoping that mine would also do the same. I'm pleased to report that it does!So be warned that ordering the white version has a chance to do this, and apparently often. I find it fun though. I'm also happy to note that there is an inactivity timer on the mouse, so when not in use, it will conserve it's battery power by turning off. Clicking with the mouse will turn it back on. Battery life has been good so far too. I work from home for 8hrs a day, and it survives my work day easily. I just plug it up to charge after work.",167,1.0,2022,01,January,25
Only worked for 3 months,5,"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. I have tried keeping it plugged in, restarting my computer and trying the mouse on a different computer and it still doesn't work. And now, of course, it's passed the time to return or get a refund. Even though it's a cute mouse, it doesn't work and I'm frustrated. :(",70,1.0,2022,01,January,25
died within a month of using,6,"I purchased this little over 6 months ago but used it only on the weekends on my personal laptop, so not much usage on gaming or extensive clicking.  Immediately noticed the charge does not hold up for less than 2 than 2 “weekend” days so I started turning it off. About 3 months later I noticed lagging in click response.. soon after, clicks were not engaging.. I replaced it with brand name (you get what you pay for).. but I thought I should contact the manufacturer and ask for refund or replacement… it’s been over 2 weeks now and no response. I do not recommend this product or its manufacturer. Beware!!",111,1.0,2022,01,January,24

Don't trust it on your apple products,7,"Haven't done many reviews but think this one was worth the time. I have hands that are a bit larger than normal and feel the mouse fits well in my palm. Very silent mouse great for both office and home use without annoying those in the area. Haven't used the mouse for gaming but also haven't had any lag with the mouse as of now so could be good for that too. Overall if you are looking for a wireless mouse, good for work and home use with good connectivity, I'd highly recommend this mouse.",95,1.0,2022,01,January,23
"Bought in late Nov, stopped working January.",7,"I bought this mouse thinking it would be a good mouse for my Mac.

I will be returning this",53,1.0,2022,01,January,23
My cat bought this,4,Love it and works great. Good purchase.,7,5.0,2022,01,January,23
Didn't last long.,3,My boyfriend got me this as a gift to help with my crafting! I love this color because it goes with my cricut. I also LOVED that it came with an adapter for my MacBook Air. These newer MacBooks require adapters for anything that is not a charging port or the newer charging cords so seeing it come with an adapter is AMAZING! I don’t have to carry around my other adapter and its very easy to use. Love it!! Thank you so much for thinking of us Apple users!!,90,3.0,2022,01,January,23
ABSOLUTE RIPOFF DO NOT GET,5,"Great mouse for the price. Nice and soft matte feel. Very quite clicks, perfect for working in a coffee shop. Works well on mouse pads and flat surfaces. And connected to my computer instantly without needing to instal any type of software. NOTE: RGB lights are not customizable. But still cute as heck and works great!",56,1.0,2022,01,January,22
Cool !,2,"The pros:Decent mouse for what I needed. I like that it is rechargeable via usb port and can be used as both wireless and wired when plugged in and recharging.The cons:These first two are mostly preferences, so take them however you wish. It sits fairly flat so there isn't much arch of your hand to rest on depending on what you are used to in a mouse. This just makes it slightly less comfortable to use based on my personal preferences. Secondly, it has a silent, soft click. Normally when you click a mouse, you feel and hear the click of the button. This feels more like I am pressing on a touch screen. There is no satisfying click nor is there a sudden give in the button, rather it feels like I'm poking a couch cushion. This could be what you want in a mouse, so do with this info what you will.This last con is not based on preferences however. I found that occasionally my cursor will studder step to the left when I am moving the mouse to the right. With the dual screens I have this means that I end up with my cursor all the way over on the other end of my work space when trying to get to the right to close a tab, or select a tool in my Adobe programs. It's nothing that has caused too many problems as it only happen every once in awhile, but it was enough to stand out and earn it's place in this review.",259,5.0,2022,01,January,22
It stopped working after 1 month.,6,"6 months into using this mouse, it can't stay charged and can barely track.  It works okay (still doesn't track well) when plugged in, but I wanted a cordless mouse for a reason.  Definitely don't recommend this one!!",38,1.0,2022,01,January,22
ez set up,3,Works great. Was a gift for my mom. She loves it,11,5.0,2022,01,January,22
Love this mouse!,3,"It's a really nice everyday mouse. The sleep mode is a little irritating because it kicks on so quickly and there doesn't seem to be a way to change it.I don't think it would be great for gaming given its limited buttons and the sleep mode thing, but it's great for office use.",53,5.0,2022,01,January,22
It works,2,The mouse had come in a greasy package and had already been opened before I opened it myself. It had brown and black stains all over the top of the mouse and was of horrible quality. Would not recommend it to anyone looking for a mouse.,46,5.0,2022,01,January,22

Cheaply made,2,"If you want a cheap light-up mouse then get this one when it’s on sale, definitely not worth the $21 price otherwise. It’s very quiet and slim, but that’s about where the benefits outweigh the cost. The actual lighting is not what’s advertised, it’s actually pretty dim even in a dark room. Beyond that, whenever you move the mouse, the red laser at the bottom for tracking movement lights up the whole mouse, taking over the other colors being displayed. Additionally, with the 2 hour charge time and the usb needed for connectivity, you’d be better off buying a nicer mouse for the same price",105,1.0,2022,01,January,21

Died 5 Months After Purchase,5,"This mouse is true to its description in that it's silent and ergonomic, but it wasn't worth the money for me--I bought it in April 2021, and had to throw it out in January 2022. Around November of 2021, I started experiencing issues with charging, where I'd have to wriggle the cord around before it would start charging. By January, it was clear that there was an issue not with the charging cable, but with the charging port in the mouse. It was loose and wiggly when I held the mouse up, and it would only charge if I held the mouse in my hand and kept the charger pressed in tightly. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a cute mouse.",120,2.0,2022,01,January,19

Could never get it to work,6,"It is a nice mouse, and I liked that it came with an adapter for the macbook. However, the adapter did not work which made the mouse unusable.

Not worth it - don't buy,6,"At first I loved this mouse. The charging time is short, the lights are nice and it worked perfectly. The adapter never worked but I looked past it since I bought a USB adapter for my Mac. Now the mouse acts like it’s dying and won’t have a good connection. It now will not charge properly. I’m so disappointed because I initially loved it. I’ve only had it since a little under a month ago. I’m so upset I wasted my money on this.

I am super happy with it.",111,1.0,2022,01,January,15
Bought another one for work,5,"Its pretty, it s ergonomic, its rechargeable (no batteries).  BUT and its a BIG BUT, the charge wears off in about a day and it takes 2 to 3 hours to recharge.  And you have to keep track of the charging cord.  The charge dissipates without warning.  This is very annoying - glad I kept my old mouse!  I'm not sure I'm keeping this.  Perhaps its a matter of habitually charging it overnight - like a phone.  I guess I'm glad I'm not a gamer! Having it quit on me at a crucial time in the game would be a disaster.",101,5.0,2022,01,January,15

Sad it didn’t work,4,"Bought two of these; one for work and one for my personal computer, in two different colors. Mouse worked great until the roller ball in each died. One after a couple months, one after less than two days. If you can live without the roller ball, then I highly recommend. But if you use it heavily, I would look at a different mouse.",63,1.0,2022,01,January,14
This mouse is terrible!!!!! Do not buy!!!!!,7,love the color affects,4,1.0,2022,01,January,14
Sleek and works great,4,I charge this mouse for an entire day and it lasts for 2 minutes. It is awful and I can tell that many other people feel this way but have gotten money to delete their review. I plan on throwing this out immediately and buying an actual rechargeable mouse,49,5.0,2022,01,January,14
Cool mouse,2,I have gotten so many compliments on this mouse! first off the rose gold color is so beautiful and dainty! when i first started using i fell in love that in changes colors and has the capability to turn off! highly recommend! great price as well!,46,5.0,2022,01,January,14

Disappointed,1,It is really quiet and colorful.,6,2.0,2022,01,January,14
Broke after 6 months,4,"The scroll wheel on the mouse broke after less than a week of using it. I liked the mouse before that. It was easy to setup, comfortable to use, and the colors look nice. I really liked the silent mouse click. But now that I can’t scroll with the mouse I will need to buy a new one",58,1.0,2022,01,January,13
good product at a great price,6,It did not work I ended up returning it.,9,5.0,2022,01,January,13
died soon after getting,4,It looks nice & lights up. Difficult to use since it freezes up the computer & for some odd reason will even knock off my bluetooth headphones. Do not waste your $,32,1.0,2022,01,January,13
Good mouse for the money,5,Kept “skipping”. Wouldn’t track properly although right next to iPad,10,4.0,2022,01,January,13

Awesome,1,I really liked the color and look of the mouse but the scroll never worked even after fully charging it.,20,5.0,2022,01,January,12
More Chinese Junk,3,I have a MacBook and this mouse required two plugins...since I take my Mac with me the chances of these 2 plugins being lost was a pain....,27,1.0,2022,01,January,12
doesn’t work,2,It was a good mouse while it lasted but died on me suddenly 5 months after purchasing. Purchased 7/15/2021 and died 1/19/2922,22,1.0,2022,01,January,12
Infant Mortality,2,"Super sad because I was obsessed with this mouse but it has already stopped working after one month. Super frustrating, should had just gone to Best Buy originally.",28,1.0,2022,01,January,12
Great Product Until It Stops Working,6,For one this mouse is not compatible with the c adapter and not worth the price by giving false information about the device. Update it and see why the c adapter isn't working or remove this item.,37,3.0,2022,01,January,12
Great customer service,3,"Nice looking mouse, beautiful colors, and comfortable hold for any sized hands.The battery on this thing is surprising, charging does take time, but seriously, that won't be a problem because this thing can last long.I do suggest turning this off to make sure the battery doesn't drain, sleep mode is brilliant but do turn it off so you won't get caught off guard for when It does lose battery.",69,5.0,2022,01,January,12
Quaility - (NOT),3,"I followed instructions for charging and tried a few different methods, but could never get this to power on or work. The company was great to quickly refund it, though.",30,1.0,2022,01,January,12
"Slim, Light, Smooth",3,The mouse falls asleep right away. The cord for recharging is only about 4 in 5 in long. Constantly needs to be recharged.  It is definitely not a five-star product.It looks cool.,32,5.0,2022,01,January,12
Cute but battery lasts for an hour before dying,9,"Be ready to turn it on and off every 2 mins of non-use, the thing goes into sleep mode then is sluggish in its response time till you restart it.  not something I would reccomend",35,2.0,2022,01,January,12
Mediocre,1,Works great long battery life love that it turns itself off very smooth used,14,4.0,2022,01,January,12
not worth the money - ugly and broke in the two weeks of use,14,"It's a cute mouse, I like the colors, and it's ergonomic. However, I've only had it for a little over 6 months and the scroll wheel just came loose and stopped working. I've never had that happen with a mouse, so it's not the best quality in the world.",49,1.0,2022,01,January,11
"Unreliable, leaves much to be desired.",6,The crazy mouse will not hold a charge. I have to plug it in after 30 minutes of use. Defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. My alkaline battery mouse would last for months and then just a simple battery replacement. Do not buy!,44,1.0,2022,01,January,09
Excellent investment for the price!,5,Comfortable to use,3,5.0,2022,01,January,09
Easy to use,3,It is so pretty. The lights are gorgeous. I love that it is rechargeable BUT the roller in the middle broke and I haven't even had it for 3 months. I use it for work so it doesn't get a lot of use either.,44,5.0,2022,01,January,09
Less than two moths - partially stopped working,8,"Till now this LED wireless rechargeable mouse is one of the items I am glad to have invested in. It is easy to use, very light and fits just right in the palm of my hand... It has a very nice modern look and is also affortable... Thank you seller for the quick delivery and aftersale communication...",57,1.0,2022,01,January,09
Wish I could return! Ugh!,5,The micro-USB to USB-C adapter does not work. You are better off ordering a mouse that connects directly to the computer via direct bluetooth (that does not need a receiver),30,1.0,2022,01,January,09
"Excellent mouse, very comfortable to use.",6,"Once I got this product I read the manual and did everything step by step including charging the mouse, and it will not work! After 5 minutes of messing with it the LED lights started flashing and I got it to work for a little while then it stopped again! This product is not good and I needed it for school, but I would hate to take an exam and i have these issues!",74,5.0,2022,01,January,09
"Laggy, slow and short battery life for MACs",8,"Works fine but it feels like a toy a kid would use. Super light and made with a thin, cheap plastic",21,2.0,2022,01,January,09
Great product and shopping experience,5,This mouse works really well. The only thing is I don’t feel like the battery lasts very long. I use it for work and those are 8 hour days of non stop computer work. I only get about 4-5 days of use before I have to recharge again.,48,5.0,2022,01,January,09
Faulty Basil??,2,It lasted last than 2 months!,6,1.0,2022,01,January,09

Great mouse. Just not really silent...,6,"Works well , but son broke within a week.  Dropped it and it shattered.",14,3.0,2022,01,January,08
Lasted less than one day before it stopped working,9,"Loved the product look and that it was rechargeable, however the battery didn’t hold the charge long enough for the device to properly connect via Bluetooth so you had to leave it plugged in which defeats the purpose of a wireless mouse. Also the shape for the mouse provided little comfort as it caused my palm to cramp after two days of use. Returning item and going back to Logitech brand.",71,1.0,2022,01,January,08
Work laptop,2,I bought this for home office and I liked it so much I bought a second one for work to use instead of what the company supplied to me.  It’s everything the description says it is.  Very comfortable too!,39,5.0,2022,01,January,08
Motion is glitchy,3,"I needed a new mouse for my laptop. I decided to wire less a must and rechargeable.  This fits all my needs, plus a an automatic setup.",27,1.0,2022,01,January,08
I love it,3,The mouse won't charge anymore... I put it on charger for hours and when my daughter trys to use it all it does is flash red and doesn't work... so much for her Christmas present,35,5.0,2022,01,January,08

So cute and works great,5,1,1,5.0,2021,12,December,14
Dead after 3 months,4,"Has worked well for over a year now (bought 10/2020). Light still glows, no issues with the function. I don't game or anything so it's had light use. It has a surprising amount of battery.",35,1.0,2022,01,January,06
It’s glitchy,2,"At first, it was great, however, after a few months, it just stopped working...disappointing.",14,3.0,2022,01,January,06
New mouse for laptop.,4,Worked fine for about 6 months then wouldn’t charge again after it died.,13,5.0,2022,01,January,06
This is Not Ergonomic!,4,"Ordered this for my new laptop, works like a charm. includes a charging cable, adapter, and usb receiver that can be stored in the bottom of the mouse. the colors light up very nicely and customer support was lovely (contacted them about activating warranty). my only issue with this mouse is the shape, which was more flat than the mice I'm used to using, but that is just personal preference and I got used to it very quickly. overall great product.",81,2.0,2022,01,January,06
"great light up mouse, i love that it's silent no more clicking",12,I had a similar mouse that lasted two years....this one died after only a month.  Would work after charging for a few minutes and then stopped.,26,5.0,2022,01,January,06
Cool lights,2,Nice mouse responds well works great with my windows 11 laptop battery life is fair haven’t had it long so far it’s been good will update,26,5.0,2022,01,January,06
Pretty and liteweight,3,"Came fast, no set up required just plug in and go. The kids in my classroom love the light up feature.",21,5.0,2022,01,January,06
Good item,2,"Battery life seems to be decent. I have two of these and both have issues with the DPI randomly changing itself so I have to click the button to change it numerous times a day. Every now and then the one I use at home doesn't 'connect' when turning on the computer. I have to unplug/re-plug the dongle. I do have it plugged into a USB switch, but seeing as it's the only device that encounters this issue I don't believe the problem is the switch. Not likely to buy this again, it's been too frustrating.",96,5.0,2022,01,January,05
Nice and quiet,3,"Unfortunately, the item doesn't recharge after just two weeks of use.  Disappointing product.",13,5.0,2022,01,January,05
Nice design and function,4,"It is nice, easy to use. I love it!",9,5.0,2022,01,January,05
The lights on this are completely annoying.,7,Another piece of China junk sold through Amazon.  Charged until the light went off (mouse charged).  Plugged it in and it stopped working minutes later.  Did the same thing a second time … same result.  Thanks Amazon for continuing to peddle garbage products to your customers.,46,2.0,2022,01,January,05
Charging port broke,3,it doesn’t work,3,2.0,2022,01,January,05
Save your money,3,"Died within the first month of use.  Nice mouse, I wanted to use it instead of the trackpad on the laptop.  Too bad it didn't work for long.",28,1.0,2022,01,January,05
Returned,1,"This was a great mouse until it stopped working after about 3 months of use. Mine appears to no longer charge. Therefore, I do not recommend buying this product.",29,1.0,2022,01,January,05
All around great purchase,4,"I ordered this mouse for a part of my son’s birthday gift. It arrived next day, and he was very excited. Unfortunately, he couldn’t click anything with it even though he could move the cursor around. Since he threw away the original box, I could not return the item, so I decided to contact the seller. They have a great customer service, and she sent me the replacement right away. This time, the mouse works perfectly fine! My son is so happy to have this cool looking mouse. The price is amazing too!",93,5.0,2022,01,January,05
Oh so easy and works GREAT,6,"Poor quality, last only 5 months",6,5.0,2022,01,January,04
Not for me.,3,"This is a great little mouse. For someone like me that has smaller hands, and some nerve issues as well, it is light, not bulky, and works so smoothly. I would highly recommend it and will purchase another for a friend!",41,3.0,2022,01,January,04
Unresponsive,1,The mouse is cute and I like the colours but it dies every hour and I have to plug it back in and just revert back to the mouse pad. Will be returning and getting something more basic with longer range of not having to be charged up.,48,3.0,2022,01,January,04
Didn’t work.,2,"It’s a decent mouse, lower middle in quality, but reasonable price at fifteen.  Feels kinda cheap, wheel is noisy.",19,1.0,2022,01,January,04
Trash!,1,"my first impression of this mouse was that the design was not well thought out. because i ordered the mouse in white, the inner workings of the lights can be seen through the top of the mouse every time you move it (and you can't turn off the red light!) because the white plastic is translucent. however, i ignored this issue because it was purely an aesthetic problem and didn't mess with the functionality of the mouse. unfortunately, a week or so later, the mouse wheel completely stopped working. i've since then gotten a new mouse for even cheaper, and not only does it look better, but it also feels better and holds up well. don't waste your money",119,1.0,2022,01,January,04
Great product,2,"I got this wireless mouse for my daughter because she was getting tired of using the old wired mouse for playing games on the PC.  So far her experience with it has been great, the size was perfect for her average teen hand and she's a lefty.  The main avantage was the mouse was rechargable so we don't have to worry about replacing the battery every so offten, a plus for me.",72,5.0,2022,01,January,04
Low battery,2,The charge port messed up not even a month later. Super disappointed,12,1.0,2021,08,August,25
Junk,1,"I purchased this mouse for home office.I don’t have a glass table, but I guess surface is too smooth for it to work.Silent operation, very comfortable.Battery lasts a decent time.Lasted for a week straight without turning it off.Not returning it but not super happy with the issue.",47,1.0,2022,01,January,04
A great gift,3,Standard wireless mouse. Works well.  What I really like about it is the colored light at the sides.  :),19,5.0,2022,01,January,03
No accurate when moving,4,"Ordered shortly after Christmas and once arrived I had issues connecting, after realizing my only route to get it to work was to constantly turn the mouse on and off. After less than a week and one charge it will no longer do anything. No lights, no power, no connection and won't charge with the included cord or any other. Spend the money on a different brand this was like ordering from wish.",73,2.0,2022,01,January,03
Doesn’t work,2,"Fits in my big hands nicely, with the mouse wheel having a non sleep feel.I bought two of these, one for my work laptop and one for my personal laptop. Not too long afterwards, one of the BT dongles went AWOL. The seller sent me a replacement which for me sealed the deal as a good investment/purchase. Of course the LED colors were icing on the cake so to speak.",70,1.0,2022,01,January,03
SUPER SLEEK AND CUTE,4,Love it!,2,5.0,2022,01,January,03
"Terrible mouse, barely works",4,"I really liked this mouse - very convenientHowever, I bought it less that 2 months ago and the wheel stopped workingVery disappointed",22,1.0,2022,01,January,03

Died after 2 1/2 months. It a as super flat and felt like poor quality.,15,Sorry. Usually I dont leave bad reviews but this one takes the cake. It started working at first but then it started to be very laggy and then no longer worked. Now.. i am using a brand new MACBOOK so maybe it's the USB converter that might be a problem. But currently not a fan.,55,1.0,2022,01,January,03
Cheap quality,2,"The texture is very good to hold, and mostly very quiet. I feel very good about this shopping experience, the shipment was very fast, and it arrived much earlier than expected.",31,1.0,2022,01,January,03

Don’t buy!,2,Love it would recommend works great love that it’s light and can’t hear when you click the mouse lights are very cute,22,1.0,2022,01,January,02
It stopped working after one charge use.,7,Loved this product but the scroll recently stopped working and I must turn it off and on during use..,19,1.0,2022,01,January,02
Doesn't work,2,"Small, lightweight yet firm solid feel. Led lighting is a nice touch. Shuts off automatically once laptop or pc is shutdown. However the main reason I purchased was because of the silent feature. Sadly it's not as silent as I had hoped. Clicks are still audible especially on scroll wheel which is disappointing. Why cant someone make a truly silent mouse? I have yet to find one as most ""silent"" mice are merely muffled by a rubber lining. Shame, would be perfect otherwise",83,1.0,2022,01,January,01
Click wheel broke in less than 3 months!,8,"This was my second purchase. I bought one in June and it worked fine. The charging port metal ""liner"" part fell out, so it couldn't be charged. I got another and used it for about an hour without any problems. I charged it, used it for another 2-3 hours, then it just suddenly quit. When I turn it off and on again, the red lights flash once then nothing. Completely useless.",71,2.0,2022,01,January,01
LED lights won't turn off,5,Love it,2,1.0,2022,01,January,01
"It's super cute, maybe a lil glitchy",7,The motion is glitchy. Sometime it moves very slow. I tried different surfaces and it didn't help.  It also goes to sleep even though I took sleep mode off.,29,4.0,2022,01,January,01
This was a gift,4,I like how it is,5,5.0,2022,01,January,01
Great wireless mouse,3,I have to say I'm impressed. Not only does it light up but I accidentally dropped it in a dog bowl full of water and it still works!!! Can't ask for more than that for the price.,37,5.0,2021,12,December,31
Disappointment,1,"This mouse is amazing, it is ergonomic, cheap and functional. Defenitly a great choice for business.For games I don't have an opinion cause I don't play computer games.",28,2.0,2021,12,December,31
It’s a good wireless mouse,5,"I travel a lot & wanted a slim, light mouse for work and school. This mouse is perfect, it’s fully charged in 3 hours, slim, comfortable to use for hours, & when fully charged it can last for days. Also the changing light affect is pretty cool. I definitely recommend this mouse for someone who either works from home or is a college student :))",65,5.0,2021,12,December,31
Cord breaks very shortly.,4,It was nice while it lasted. Unfortunately for me that was less than three months...,15,3.0,2021,12,December,31

A good quality mouse.  I would buy again.,8,"Just plug and play.  So easy to use and very sleek and slim looking. I like it when the light lid up.  Its soo cool! This is my 1st rechargeable mouse.  I really like it!  I am going to try it for a month and if it work well, I will buy another one.",54,5.0,2021,12,December,30
Pretty good mouse!,3,No computer mouse was amazing,5,5.0,2021,12,December,30
Nice Feel,2,Nice mouse for a few months of light use. After that it would not take a charge even tried swapping cables. Big disappointment,23,5.0,2021,12,December,30
Has never properly worked,4,I’ve had this mouse for less than a month and it’s already glitching out moving the curser without me moving the actual mouse. Cool colors though,26,1.0,2021,12,December,30
Stopped working after a month,5,"I needed a new mouse for my laptop and decided on this design based on its ergonomics.  However, I’m used to the taller mouse so it took some getting used to this design.  I’m not completely sold on it, but I’ll give it a go.",45,1.0,2021,12,December,30
Meh,1,"I've been using it for less than 2 hours, and my wrist is already quite sore. There is no ergometric support whatsoever. And are all the lights really necessary? I find them annoying.",33,2.0,2021,12,December,29

Does not last,3,Only used it a few times and I like it.,10,5.0,2021,12,December,29
2nd replacement: mouse doesn’t power on after being fully charged,10,"The mouse works fine. It is slim, kind of cheap plastic, but the lights - which in photos look like it would just be a thin line around the mouse - are very annoying. The entire thing lights up. You can not turn them off and still use the mouse, it is very distracting. I did not try to return it because there is nothing else wrong, but I will donate it to charity or someone. Ordered another one with no lights!",82,1.0,2021,12,December,29
"Okay, not worth it imo",5,Used for 6 months and now it won't charge.,9,2.0,2021,12,December,28
Good product,2,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. For a “wireless” and “rechargeable” mouse it sure didn’t get the memo. It refuses to work without being plugged in, we’ve let it charge over night and everything. Would not recommend.",38,5.0,2021,12,December,28
Stopped working,2,Very good mouse. I'd recommend.,5,1.0,2021,12,December,28
Shallow click,2,Felt cheap. Returned for a better product,7,3.0,2021,12,December,28
best mouse for the price,5,"So cute and ergonomic, holds the charge really well probably due to its auto sleep mode and works like a charm!",21,5.0,2021,12,December,27
Not Bluetooth,2,"Easy to use directly from it's box. Simply charge it with the USB cord included. Plug in the dongle receiver to your device. Reboot your device and it locates and installs itself. Turn the mouse on and your ready to work or play, etc",44,4.0,2021,12,December,27
Terrible at connecting,3,"Not enough of a curve to use comfortably.  Performed it's basic functions, for the short time it was used.",19,2.0,2021,12,December,27
Great mouse,2,I bought this mouse with the expectation that it will work… however it becomes unresponsive (freezes) frequently enough that I have to use my touch pad half the time. Cheap and fun but not good if you use a mouse often.,41,5.0,2021,12,December,27
"as described, easy to use",5,Seems nice enough in the hand but didn’t work. Could click both the left and right mouse buttons but moving the mouse would not do anything. Had to return.,29,5.0,2021,12,December,27
"So far, so good",4,Glitches after 3 minutes on all my devices lol this thing is straight up garbage,15,4.0,2021,12,December,27
Piece of crap,3,I was skeptical of how good this mouse would work and it is great. I really enjoy that it has a feature to shut it off.  The last wireless mouse I had ran on batteries and died all the time bc it wouldn’t shut off. It is smooth to move around and works great !,55,1.0,2021,12,December,27
Scroll Wheel Brakes Easily,4,The first 30 seconds it works fine. Then is glitchy and is worthless.,13,2.0,2021,12,December,26

Great little mouse!,3,Out of the package my initial thoughts were that the product seemed very cheaply made and those thoughts were confirmed when after one month of use the product stopped working. Would not recommend this product.,35,5.0,2021,12,December,26
It’s super cheap and it didn’t work.,7,"It works fine however, sometimes it does not response when you move your hand. I also do not recognize when the DPI is activated or not.

Cute but unresponsive,3,Won’t work at all!,4,3.0,2021,12,December,26
Doesn't connect to Mac/ Bad Tracking,6,Definitely worth the money,4,1.0,2021,12,December,26
Sleek and comfortable mouse,4,"Ergonomically I find it to be too short and a bit uncomfortable. I bought it as a travel mouse so I could over look that, except that it barely works. Every time I have tried to use it it eventually gets super laggy and almost impossible to use. Turning it off and on again fixes it but only until it starts to lag again.",64,5.0,2021,12,December,26

Wireless mouse,2,Currently returning this product. Even after adjusting several things on it this mouse just doesn't do the job. Hard to click so when you do get a click in it's not where you wanted it.,35,3.0,2021,12,December,23

I tried using 6 different chargers including its own. I've left it charging for a few hours and nothing! Super disappointed.",37,5.0,2021,12,December,23
Junk,1,"I plugged it in to charge for 4 hours, the moment I unplugged it, it wouldn't turn on and wouldn't connect to my laptop. but if it was plugged in, it worked and connected.

Good Mouse,2,"I liked the look, feel, and price of this mouse. However, after less than 3 months of moderate use, while playing a game, I clicked the ""wheel"" and it broke. This item was not made to last. Cheap and not worth the money in my opinion.",46,4.0,2021,12,December,22
Cool little mouse,3,"I had this mouse before without the LED lights, worked like a charm. But despite this version that says the LED lights are able to turn off...they DON'T. The switch on the bottom to shut off the lights do not work, the ""ON"" button shuts off the whole mouse instead of just the lights. So basically I'm stuck with annoying flashing lights.",62,5.0,2021,12,December,22
Great for a laptop,4,"It's really nice, exactly what I wanted except when it changes in light it does automatically and the transition is a bit glitchy at times ,but i still love it.",30,5.0,2021,12,December,22

1,1,"Overall, I really liked the mouse. I enjoyed the colors and the feel of it was very nice. The main problem I had is that I specifically bought it for work for my Mac laptop. The adapter didn't work at all. I had to keep holding it down at a specific angle in order to use it at all. Very disappointing......",61,5.0,2021,12,December,22

"Stops working, plus lot of glitches",6,"I'm happy with my purchase! It wasn't an expensive mouse, it's wireless and rechargeable, all things I was looking for. It is a slim mouse which took some time for me to get used to. I only use it for office work tasks so I can't speak to other uses. However I don't notice any lags, delays or other issues. I do wish there was some way to control the colors but it's not a big deal. Also the top clear button clicks but I haven't figured out what that does.",91,1.0,2021,12,December,21

Worth it,2,I loved this mouse until it stopped working after about a month of use. It is plugged in and charging but is not responding to movement after about ten minutes. I’ve tried multiple ports and turning it on and off but the thing won’t respond. It’s illuminating in just blue which it’s never done before. Don’t buy it,58,5.0,2021,12,December,21

Not comfortable,2,I purchased this with the hope to use it for my home office to get rid of my corded mouse.

Terrible mouse,2,"This mouse is prettt okay. It works fine and lights up pretty, which is a bonus. I’m not a fan of the feeling of clicking, though. I wish I bought a different mouse for that reason. But I will hold onto it for now.",44,1.0,2021,12,December,18
How do I fix this?,5,no one problem so far it works perfectly and the look is amazing,13,1.0,2021,12,December,18
Efficient,1,"I bought this mouse to replace an older one that had just cracked.  I love the feature of charging them by USB in place of batteries.  So much more convenient.  Easy to setup, mouse clicks are completely silent which is also a nice feature.  The changing led color light on the inside is just a bonus that makes it looks cool.  Comfortable use, slim design and really like the no-slip material of the mouse.",74,5.0,2021,12,December,18
Does the job at a great price,7,"I was searching for Bluetooth mouse. I found one, but didn't like the color. When I changed to the silver one, some how it switched off of Bluetooth.It is wireless and did work with the USB dongle.The buttons are quiet and the movement was smooth.Unfortunately I have a MAC and the USB ports are only USB-C. The mouse does come with an adapter, but this makes it stick out far and will get damaged.I had to return it.",78,5.0,2021,12,December,17

WORST MOUSE EVER,3,"When I received this product the first time, it had come broken. The entire click pad was nearly separated from the base and couldn’t easily be snapped back into place. I sent in for a replacement and everything was all fine! They sent a replacement no problems. This was in April.Flash forward to December, a mere eight months. The mechanism that holds the scroll wheel somehow snapped apart and the scroll wheel is now 100% useless, which makes playing games a bit difficult, as many games use the scroll wheel. When to contact customer service? All contact is closed.Use caution when ordering this mouse. At first, the replacement I had been sent was good, despite it not exactly having any sort of indicator as to when the mouse needed to be charged; but if the scroll wheel’s mechanisms are gonna snap easily under potentially hard gaming sessions? Perhaps pass for something more heavy duty.",154,1.0,2021,12,December,16

Keeps turning off and disconnecting,5,"This is a really great mouse; it works as designed.  Unfortunately, I don't have the patience for the very slow response time. It was aggravating waiting for it to respond to my finger commands. Needless to say, I got rid of it and bought something different.",46,1.0,2021,12,December,16
INCREDIBLE!,1,its just not good at all. the colors don't show as good as shown. It does not connect to MacBook and the mouse tracking his slow and horrible,28,5.0,2021,12,December,15
Type C adaptor does not work,6,I love this mouse. It has a cute and ergonomic design and doesn’t need to be charged often. The only thing I don’t like about the matte black one is that it shows fingerprints easily.,35,2.0,2021,12,December,15
Junk mouse.,2,I've had this mouse for almost a month now and it's great quality and works awesome stays charged for a while I've only had to change it once and I use it for working at home several hours a day! Definitely recommend ! I got the pink one and it's so cute!!,52,1.0,2021,12,December,15
Works good with underpad,4,"Not only does this feel like the cheapest mouse I have ever had the displeasure of holding, the USB type C adapter is a loose fitting piece of junk.  Not even worth the hassle of returning.  This piece of garbage only flashes red for a second then quits doing anything else (even after being charged for 8 hours).  I have attached it to 4 different devices and nothing.  I guess you get what you pay for and I this instance...JUNK",80,4.0,2021,12,December,15

buena compra.,2,"So, I do like that the mouse fits well in my hand. Is very responsive and works very well for everyday use. I like that the mouse click is very quiet. I have had NO problems with the mouse so far. I would recommend this mouse as it works very well and you can also adjust the sensitivity, or how fast it tracks by adjusting the DPI. Nice feature to have.",71,5.0,2021,12,December,15
Stoped working with in 5 minutes of use,8,These stop working after a short while. Bought 4. They all have been returned. Spend a couple bucks more and buy a different unit,24,1.0,2021,12,December,15
Qork reliable,2,"Mouse is nice, I thought there was an option to not have it light up since I don't need that function but the 3 options are off, one color, and alternating many colors. It only lights up while you are moving it and the light is off when its still. Glides good, clicks well. My only really issue with it is the scroller wheel can be a little unreliable, if i want to scroll down just a line or two it won't move and then if i scroll just a little faster it zooms down the page. Overall decent",99,5.0,2021,12,December,15
It’s just fine,3,"its a cool little mouse, got it for work reasons like the RGB on it. works as intended. not really pricey.",21,3.0,2021,12,December,15

Doesn't Work,2,"Update 4.2.22: I tried charging more often and making sure I turned it off. Seems it doesn't last as long as I'd hoped. Switched back to battery operated Bluetooth mouse.Worked well for the time being. I bought 2 and the other is still working, for now. As of now, I've tried to use it on notebook, tablet, and desktop to ensure it's a connection issue. Maybe it's the battery, but I'm not sure. If sleep mode is active, the battery shouldn't be having issues in such a brief time of having it. It should last a few days after a full charge (overnight).",103,1.0,2021,12,December,14
Worked great. . . for two weeks,7,Love the mouse my only downfall is that it’s very light and I’m used to a little heavier one so it’s something to get used too.,26,1.0,2021,12,December,14
Works good with MacBook pro 2021,6,The mouse no matter how much I charge it no longer turns on or connects to my computer. I normally try to avoid making negative reviews but this is honestly not worth the money I spent on this. All I wanted was a mouse to help me work on my Macbook and this was just a huge disappointment.,58,5.0,2021,12,December,14
Battery life? More like battery death,6,"I purchased this to replace a broken battery operated cordless mouse.  I think I dropped it one too many times. I thought I would give this rechargeable mouse a try. I hope that I won't have to recharge it too often.  I only had to do the initial charge so far, and I do a lot of clicking. I also chose this one for its flatter design.  My other one was higher, and after using it a long time my hand got stiff.  Maybe this one won't do that. So far it hasn't.",93,2.0,2021,12,December,14
scroll button does not work,5,Only worked a few weeks and thats it. Waste of money. Whats worse is I barely used it.,18,1.0,2021,12,December,14

"Love, Love, Love this mouse!!!",5,"So... my review after using this mouse for 2 months:- there are a lot of glitches that makes the cursor on screen jump from one area to another- the mouse STOPS WORKING in the middle even after making sure it is fully charged. You have to turn off the mouse, put the mouse on charge for an hour to get the mouse to start working again. I will not recommend this mouse to ANYONE!!!!- Couple days later... the mouse has completely stopped working and there's no customer service response.Update: The mouse is still not working. I have made three attempts so far to reach out to the company, but they don't respond. The quality of customer service: 0.Update 2. It’s been over 8 months since I got the replacement… even the replacement is horrible. It stops responding. The action time is delayed. When you left click… it doesn’t respond. This is even after I carefully keep the mouse.",158,5.0,2021,12,December,14
Terrible mouse,2,I have had this mouse for a while now. I love it! It's perfect size and the color change is probably my favorite part. I don't have to recharge it everyday but I really only use it for work. so I work an 8 hour day again it really doesn't need to be charged often. When it's time for a charge the color will start to shift to red. Everyone that's seen it has asked where I got it and that they want one!,84,1.0,2021,12,December,14
Worked Great at First then died!,6,I bought 2 of these back in October for me and my mom. After a month and and a half of regular use for mine it no longer works. I thought I wasn't charging it enough until I opened my mom's. Hers brand new out the box did not work either. Very very disappointed. I will not be purchasing again. Do not but it isn't worth it.,67,1.0,2021,12,December,14
Que sea de buena calidad los productos,7,"This mouse was very useful and relatively enjoyable the first week and a half. At two weeks, it seemed to glitch. The cursor would jerk and freeze. So I connected the mouse to the charger. It was ok for a couple of days, but sadly succumbed to its cheapness this afternoon.Very cheaply made product. Maybe those 4/5 star reviews are bought?  Very disappointing.",63,4.0,2021,12,December,14

Battery last a good time before a recharge,8,"I bought this 3 month ago was working perfectly fine until last week then for no reason it stop working properly.

Don't be taken in by the pictures....trust the previous poor reviews.",51,5.0,2021,12,December,13
Very Quiet!,2,"I was a bit skeptical about it being a “quiet” clicker but was pleased to learn it really is quiet. The clicks are greatly muffled and are soft to the…click. My only complaint is that the scrolling wheel does not click quietly.The lights are enjoyable but don’t display a constant stream of colors as they forcibly/manually change when moved or clicked. They otherwise will rotate when the mouse is left idle.Overall, it’s a really nice mouse to buy and use. Comfortable and light—kind of reminds me of the Apple mouse.",90,5.0,2021,12,December,13
Mouse,1,"I loved this mouse.  I used it for a few hours of office work once every week or two.  So very light use in the scheme of things for a computer mouse.

Poor quality,2,"It wasn't until my husband gave me his mouse to play my Sims 4 with that I realized how much I loved using one, even on a laptop. He said I could have his red and black one, but lo-and-behold, when I opened up Amazon and put in 'wireless mouse', I found my own type of dream mouse. I got the mint green colored one and honestly I'm obsessed with the glowing of the different colors. Great mouse, great price. I wish I needed more than one to be honest.",90,1.0,2021,12,December,11

Does NOT work with MacBook,5,So I got this in the mail and immediately started using it. It worked great in the beginning. Super quiet and the color change is cool but after a week or two I was using it and it just stopped working. It would turn on but wouldn't work on my laptop and it was the only computer I have used it on. I can barely get it to move on the screen and then it just shuts off.

VERY BUTTOMS are HARD TO CLICK  - AND THE LIGHT IS ONLY RED,13,"This is the worst wireless mouse I've ever had the displeasure of using. I bought it thinking how bad can it really be, it just needs to connect to my laptop. Well, if this could be a negative star rating I would do it. If you stop moving the mouse for 10 seconds or more, you have to turn it off and then turn it back on again because it loses its tracking and doesn't respond to your movements. It doesn't have any accuracy while clicking things and its uncomfortable to use. IT IS GARBAGE.",95,3.0,2021,12,December,11

The Mouse Clicking is very quiet.,6,I like this mouse because of the LEDs and the color. But the USB converter that it comes with is not reliable. I had to use a different one in order for the mouse to be usable. I have also noticed sometimes a lag in clicks so I wouldn’t suggest this for gaming or something where you need to be super responsive and precise,64,5.0,2021,12,December,09
It’s twitchy,2,"I bought this mouse in April 2021.  I liked it a lot for 8 1/2 months.  For the last few weeks, it has stopped tracking reliably and the battery dies within about a half hour.  Even if I try to use it plugged into the computer, it stops tracking and the lights dim.  I can't find any warranty information on it.  I feel like it should have lasted more than 9 months.  I think I'll buy a wireless mouse with a known brand name and hope for better luck.",89,1.0,2021,12,December,08
Not incredibly durable,3,"Its just literally not working at all. I charged it for three hours and connected the USB to the adapter and plugged it in to my MacBook and it just does not work. I have turned it on and off, put the USB back in the mouse and tried again and again and it just will not work. Instructions were absolutely useless since it just said to turn the mouse on and off.",73,2.0,2021,12,December,08
Convenient Light Mouse,3,"First purchase, I received the wrong color. They switched it out no problem. Second mouse came, and it stopped working within two -three weeks. Because of the shipping coming from overseas the whole process just made the product less appealing. Disappointed it stopped working so soon.",46,5.0,2021,12,December,08
Quick and Convent,3,I get so many compliments in the office about my mouse. It’s a huge hit in the office and now 4 coworkers own it in different colors,27,5.0,2021,12,December,08
Another throwaway product,3,I purchased this mouse for using with MacBook pro 2021. There is no lag while using it and is compatible with MacBook.,22,2.0,2021,12,December,08
It doesn't work,3,Just stopped working after the 2nd charge cycle.  It worked well at first but then just stopped working.  Waste of money.,21,1.0,2021,11,November,29
Going to buy 2 more!,5,"Okay, I understood that having a mouse with cool shifting lights was probably going to result in somewhat reduced battery life; I just didn’t expect THIS. The mouse seems to have no sleep mode (the lights stay on unless it’s completely switched off), and the battery lasts less than two days, brand new. I thought to myself that I could make that work by just remembering to plug it in at night, because I do like how the mouse feels and works ... except last night I plugged it in, and this morning, 10 hours later, it WASN’T DONE CHARGING. I have resorted to just keeping it plugged in all day while using it, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a wireless mouse in the first place, and ties up two USB ports instead of just one. Shame. Back to the drawing board on my mouse search.",149,5.0,2021,12,December,08
Works good.,2,"overall I really like the mouse, but the scroll button doesn't work. Also, I was not able to find a way to contact the seller to resolve the issue.",29,4.0,2021,12,December,08

Amazing,1,"I’ve had for lass than a month and it already doesn’t work anymore. I left it on for a couple hours while i was away (fully charged and working perfectly when i left) and when i came home, it refused to work. i have charged it, i have taken out the usb and reinserted it and i have turned it off and on a million times and it just doesn’t work anymore. i am so incredibly disappointed and upset that this broke after less than a month and cannot return it as i don’t have the original packaging anymore. i would give negative stars if i could. i wish i could get my money back to buy a different mouse but unfortunately i can’t anymore. don’t waste your money on this.",131,5.0,2021,12,December,06

Love this mouse!,3,This is a great cordless mouse. It is rechargeable as long as the computer is on.  There is a place on the bottom to store the dongle if not in the computer.  If dropped it will come apart.  Unfortunately it does fly in a special education classroom.  A stronger shell would be great. Also an extra dongle in case you lose the first one.,64,5.0,2021,12,December,03

pretty but useless,3,"If you are like me and have trouble using USB to USB-C converters (somehow I always end up with flaky ones that don't maintain a connection) be warned that this mouse uses the same method to support USB-C. It comes with a USB and USB-C adapter, however you have to plug the USB-C into the USB adapter to use it. You cannot use the USB-C adapter on its own. Which means I have a 2"" long, double adapter sticking out of my computer, just waiting to get knocked off. Had I known up front that the USB-C adapter required the USB adapter to work, I would not have made this purchase.",111,2.0,2021,12,December,02

Great product,2,"I bought this because I hate using the mouse pad on my laptop and it’s great to throw in my laptop bag and pull out when I need it. It charges by plugging it into the laptop but I haven’t had to do that yet besides giving it a full charge when I opened it up the first time. It does go into sleep mode to save the battery which took a minute to figure out but once you realize that it’s not broken, just asleep, it’s all good! Overall it’s just a basic wireless mouse that works well and is sleek and portable.",104,5.0,2021,12,December,02

Horrible,1,I really like this mouse for work. I use mine all day I charge it on Wednesday mid week and leave it charging Friday over the weekend. Works completely fine. I'm coming back and buying two more. I had to come buy more because I dropped mine and it cracked open that's the only reason why. Not because it stopped working but because I broke mine so this time in also getting a backup! My work laptop is a Mac and I'd rather much buy this mouse than the expensive Apple one.,92,1.0,2021,12,December,02
Pretty cool,2,"The idea of this mouse sounded nice and fun. However, I was very disappointed to see that the usb is slightly bigger than other usb cables and it did not fit into my laptop, or any other usb port for that matter.

DONT BUY!,2,"i followed all instructions, nothing happened, and the mouse does not work at all, nothing pops up linking the mouse to my computer",23,1.0,2021,12,December,01
I hate it,3,"And it's only wireless half the time. The other half you'll have it plugged in and charging because a charge doesn't last very long. That's why they give you that little short charging wire that plugs in the front of the mouse. That makes it hard to use when charging. Everyone knows it's easier to drag a chain up a hill than to push it up. Well, everyone but these people.Update - the battery has completely gone dead. It won't even take a charge anymore after only three months. You have to keep it plugged into your laptop at all times, and even then it goes dead occasionally if you use it too much or too fast. You have to wait 10 to 20 seconds for it to ""charge"" just so you can use it for another 5 seconds. It's even worse than the 2 star rating I gave it originally.",151,1.0,2021,12,December,01

This one definitely does the trick and looks nice with the colors on the side but also has a couple downsides: the DPI change button doesn't work on Mac, the colors at the border aren't really bright and even + the red light of the sensor always shines through, it also is a bit small if you have big hands (which is a upset if you're traveling, since it will fit in small spaces)In general: it is a good mouse if you do not want to spend a lot of money but there are things that could be better if you want to spend a bit more.",126,5.0,2021,11,November,25

Doesn’t respond to clicking,4,The mouse is slim and lightweight. I love the way that the inbuilt LED light in the mouse changes its colors. It is very easy to install the mouse on the laptop.  The day I bought the mouse I have been using it without charging the battery for 15 days. After surfing the mouse on amazon I thought I found the right mouse for my computer.,66,1.0,2021,11,November,21

Love it,2,I had high hopes due to all the positive reviews but this mouse became virtually useless after just 3 weeks. I would move the mouse on the mouse pad back and forth and it would barely move on the screen. Every task on the computer began to take 4x's the amount of time it used to. I had to resort to using the trackpad on my Macbook which I'm not a fan of. Definitely don't get this mouse. Not worth it.,81,5.0,2021,11,November,19

Stopped holding charge after 2-months,5,"It was a great mouse, until it stopped working and charging. I literally only used it about 5-6 times since buying it and when I put it on the charger this last time, it just completely stopped working. The charger light wouldn't come on and it wouldn't charge. I even switched USBs to see if it maybe had a short in the wire, and still nothing.Now that I'm reading other reviews, I see the problem. Wish I would have read them thoroughly before buying it.Buy this only if you want something short-lasting, with pretty colors. Other than that, I don't recommend this at all.",104,1.0,2021,11,November,17

Cool product,2,"You get what you pay for.  Noted.I have to click this mouse at least three times to get it to do what i want, on any button on it. It is so frustrating and i find myself wishing i would have spent more for a quality product, which i may now have to do anyway bc im just so unhappy with it.  It is so cheaply made (plastic all around) i wonder how this can justify a price of over $5.  JMO. Others seem to like it. It just was not what i am looking for. I used it as replacement to my iMac mouse (circa 2012) which finally died. I miss the magic mouse but not $79 worth. Lol im going to have to find a happy medium. This mouse doesn't get it. At all.Only redeeming factor is it is rechargeable.",142,5.0,2021,11,November,17

Best mouse ever!,3,This product is awful,4,5.0,2021,11,November,16
Excellent mouse for day to day usage,7,"First off I love the color, it’s what made me purchase it in the first place. I didn’t need a mouse, but I like having a spare.Now for my review, as far as what I’m used to for comfort, this mouse sits FLAT. So be aware of that if you plan on using it for long periods of time. Fits nicely in your hand, I have medium small hands, so please take that into consideration with the review.The lights, I loved the different light modes, it actually made it feel like I had a $150 gaming mouse, while not being so hard on my wallet.Now for push button response… my right click wasn’t working properly, barely clicked down and would sometimes Mia click from it being mispositioned. I had to lift it up to see the issue was the prong was bad. I broke it off and now it is clicking as intended. So please be aware, this is all VERY fragile plastic within its housing.Overall the mouse is great if you need a spare, and I would buy again if I needed another. I hate out of 5 stars, because 4/5 feels worse than 8/10…but I feel an 8/10 is more accurate to how I feel, as it has a lot of great features, such as charging vs batteries (and an included usb-c adapter). Overall a wonderful product that I do recommend",233,5.0,2021,11,November,11
Great mouse with slick design,5,"UPDATE 12/6/21:Seller has contacted me asking me to remove my review and attempting to bribe me with money to do so. I expected this as several other comments say they too received the same bribery. They even went as far as sending me a “here’s how to remove” link.Purchased this as an upcoming Christmas gift for my sister as it was similar to one she wanted that is not available right now. The box for the mouse is mostly in another language and paired with the price that prompted me to test it before wrapping it up and giving it to her come the holiday. Let me just say, I am glad that I did.While the mouse powered on and worked fine with the USB dongle that it requires be plugged in to use, I decided to test it's other feature of being able to charge it while using it. Everything worked fine UNTIL I UNPLUGGED IT. Once I unplugged the micro-usb cable from the mouse my entire PC turned OFF. I thought maybe it was just a fluke so I tested it again. Nothing happened the second time so I plugged it back in for a little bit to make sure it had a full charge on it for her, and when I unplugged it to re-package it, it happened again. As to say I am now running virus detecting software to err on the side of caution and this product is getting returned as defective.Moral of the store, don't buy cheap products.",254,5.0,2021,11,November,16

"Great product, Fast shipping",4,"The colors are fun and different. The thing I did not like was that the default color is red, if it is not in rainbow mode. The material is okay. It works at it should. It is great that its rechargeable. It holds a charge for a long time, and if you forget to turn it off, the sleep mode works well.",62,5.0,2021,11,November,15

So far it works great for the inexpensive price!",62,1.0,2021,11,November,15
Never works,2,"I've tried so many wireless mice over the years and one of the most annoying has always been how quickly the battery dies and they are not included. When I ordered this mouse, I got it because it lit up and matches my laptop. When I got it, I was pleased to learn it was rechargeable! Mind blown and brilliant! The mouse, will go into a sleep mode when you aren't using it, or you can turn it off and on easily.Perhaps the only con is that it doesn't come with instructions.Absolutely, love this mouse and I highly recommend it!!",100,5.0,2021,11,November,15

Stopped working less than 24h after I unpacked it.,9,"I needed a wireless mouse for my new MacBook Pro that only has USB-C connections.  This mouse included an adapter that allowed the standard USB Bluetooth receiver to be used in the USB-C port.  I have only had an opportunity to use it in limited situations thus far, but it seems very responsive and performed well.  The led lights are kinda cool, but not really needed.  I'm trying to see if there is a way to use the mouse without the led lights on so I can conserve the charge on the battery.  The only concern/issue I've had thus far is that the charging cable connection to the mouse and the adapter don't seem to be the most secure, and a couple times it seemed like the connection came loose and the mouse was no longer charging.  I was still using my laptop while the mouse was charging via the USB-C port as recommended in the user manual.  The user manual specifically recommends NOT using a plug-in charging adapter like for most cell phones because it might overcharge the mouse and damage it.  It is recommended that you only use the provided cable and charge it via your laptop to avoid overcharging and damaging the mouse.  I'm not certain how great an option this is since it seems to come loose and stop charging occasionally if I continue to use my laptop while trying to charge the mouse.  We'll see how it goes in the future.  If it turns out that it was operator error, I may update my rating.Overall, though, the mouse feels good in my hand, and it seems to work well, doing everything necessary when I need it.",281,1.0,2021,11,November,10

Would plug in to charge (using an open USB port on my switch was super convenient), turning it off every night while it charged.  The next day, unplug and flip it to the middle setting so lights were not on constantly, and I was able to use for the whole day 8-10hrs no problem.  Then, about two weeks ago, same usual routine, go to use the next day and completely dead.  Revert back to wired mouse and let it charge until lunch (4hrs later), swap back out... lights come on for about 10 seconds and again: completely dead.Now I'm out of the return policy not even 6 months later and screwed.",142,5.0,2021,11,November,09

The only issue I face is that the RGB on the front of the mouse is almost completely broken and there are small sections around the edges that are broken as well. It doesn't prevent the mouse from doing its job though and I often find myself using the mouse with the RGB off anyway.

Have purchased 2,3," OH MY GOD. This was EVERYTHING I was looking for. I bought a mouse and keyboard for my phone, because I wanted to type my essays on my phone, when I don't have a computer. And this mouse works on my phone! Yay! And it's my favorite color",48,1.0,2021,11,November,05
I am using everyday and I don't have a negative comment.  Love it,13,"So we’ve gone thru quite a few wireless items over the last few years. This one by far has knocked it out of the park. I actually allowed my 9 year old to pick her mouse this year (she’s 9) and she picked based on color. I read the description. The review’s were good and the price was right so we hit “buy now”. I love sleep mode, I really love that it’s rechargeable, battery lasts weeks. I like that it lights up when it’s charging and let’s you know when it’s done. And an added bonus: it’s the cutest shade of baby pink.",104,5.0,2021,11,November,05
Dont watse time or money,5,"This product does what I need it to do, and does it perfectly. I'm super picky about stuff, and I can honestly say I am very well pleased. I do believe I have to turn it off for a moment when it hibernates, but that is whatever to me. Haha",50,1.0,2021,11,November,05
Broken first fall,3,"Wireless mouse went out ordered this one. Arrived early. Feels good in hand, easy to control. The lights are ""cute"" as they change colors lol. But the overall feel is good. Not huge and the recharge is most def the highlightThank you",42,1.0,2021,11,November,05
"Slim fit, great price",4,The tracking on this mouse is not great and to add insult to injury the mouse stopped working after about 2 months.  Worse yet I missed the return window by days.,31,5.0,2021,11,November,05
Scroll Wheel collapsed after 3 months,6,I’ve been using this mouse for work since I received this last month. It worked great the whole time and I charged it once a week. Now it won’t turn in. I thought it needed to be charged so I plugged it in for a few hours. I turned it back on and it won’t work at all.Normally the lights are all on when the switch is on. It won’t even pick up my cursor and I have to use a different mouse to work. Very disappointed that it didn’t even last me more than a month. Don’t waste your money.EDIT: the seller emailed me offering me money to delete my review. Sounds like they do that to everyone. Seems like there would  be way more negative reviews for this trash product if they weren’t paid to delete them.,139,1.0,2021,11,November,05
Broken,1,Charge last forever,3,2.0,2021,11,November,05
Don’t waste your money…,4,"UPDATE: I actually purchased three of these and received them on August 20. I began using one immediately for work. I put another one in my computer bag for when I travel and the third was intended as a back up. As noted below, less than 3 months after I purchased these, the first one which I was using daily quit working. I got the one from my computer bag which had never been used because my travel for work has been limited due to the pandemic. This one quit working after only 4 days, on November 15. I then went to the third one that I bought as back up. After using this one for less than a week, it has started to malfunction. The scroll wheel has quit working, but everything else still works. On November 23, I received an email from the manufacturer asking me to delete my review in exchange for a refund. I received another email the next day with misrepresentation that it was from Amazon ""costumer service"" also asking me to delete my review in exchange for a refund that I could expect in 48 hours after removing the review. I'm not sure if the misspelling was intentional to avoid getting in trouble with Amazon or just poor commend of the English language.I purchased this on August 20 and it quit working on November 11, less than three months after I purchased it. The return window was 30 days so no chance I will get refunded for this piece of garbage. Don’t waste your money on this.",263,1.0,2021,11,November,04

That it works,3,"This is a nice, sleek little mouse. I'm very pleased with the size and the connection/range. I was looking for one that wasn't too clunky but still looked decent.

I am this every single day, all the day and with the lights on. It has 2 functions,... The first one is like On, snf the second is with lights. I love it, I charge it once every few weeks and it is so silent, I can use it doing my studies till midnight, no problem with the clicking. I can charge it with the USB, so I don't have to change a battery. After few months, my mouse is working sooo good and if it is not charged, then I can connect to USB and continue to work with it.

It’s a great mouse for a little while,8,My favorite thing about this mouse is how smooth it feels to the touch. The colors are a great addition and add to the experience of using it. It feels sleek as you move it on a mousepad and all other surfaces and textures. The customer service has been splendid.

CRAP,1,"Works, and the battery lasts a week or two with frequent use and charges easily. One less cord to get snarled in my laptop case, too.The lights around the edge seem silly, but do make it easy to keep track of it in the dark.Goes to sleep after a few minutes of nonuse, requires a mouse click to wake it up, a nuisance, but that means you need not bother to turn it off.Overall, very pleased.",76,1.0,2021,10,October,29

Mouse is meh and here’s why…,6,"I plugged it in and let it charge over night, I was so excited to use it becuae I though it was so cute. DID NOT WORK FROM DAY 1When I turned the power on it would flash red, then I would try to use it and nothing - Zero - Zip- nothing would work.Waste of time buying it, waste of time trying to get it to work, and now waste of time having to return it.

I can't recommend this for any kind of long-term situation,10,The plug to use in a MacBook does not work.

Works great for Surface Go2,5,"The product is cheap and worked well for the first 2 months, but after that it started becoming unresponsive. I would plug it in because I thought it was low in power, but that didn't solve the issue either. I use a lap top and have a lap desk where it has a built in mouse pad area. I've had it for years so I was thinking it was too old and worn down and the mouse wasn't able to read it. So I bought a new 3M mouse pad, but still nothing. Tried updating drivers with various programs, tweaked a bunch of settings and followed the advice from several websites. Nothing. So I disconnected it and brought out my WIRED  mouse and it isn't working either! This product even disabled my track pad, but luckily I found a way to get it working. I blame this crap product, as it literally almost bricked my laptop",156,5.0,2021,10,October,27

great mouse for a awesome price,6,"After two months of non-regular use this mouse has already stopped working properly.

Was good while it worked and liked the color of it but only two months of use is unacceptable when there are other similar priced options from other companies.",58,5.0,2021,10,October,27

Great price and quick delivery,5,"I really like this mouse. I love that it doesn't need batteries! You just charge it and it's ready to go. I did have a issue with my MacBook Pro when connecting the adapter for the receiver it comes with to my computer, it changed my scrolling ability on my laptop trackpad, and I wasn't able to scroll without using the mouse. I had to call Apple to figure out how to fix it and that's when I discovered removing the usb-c adapter the mouse comes with from my computer solved the problem. I have a usb-c to USB adapter from the Mac store, so I just used that for the mouse receiver and it worked perfectly, and it doesn't change my scrolling ability with the trackpad at all.",129,5.0,2021,10,October,27

Already stopped working,3,"Constantly ""times out"" or goes to sleep, and every time I try to move it to use it again, it takes me having to sit there and shake it for ten seconds - at first, not a big deal, but do that for a few weeks, and it's incredibly frustrating. I went back to my old mouse. I'll know next time to pay for a better mouse.",67,2.0,2021,10,October,27

Was great u til now,5,"I was wary of buying a no-name brand mouse, but it turned out to be even better than I expected. It’s super sleek and looks great with the LEDs. It also functions VERY well - the clicks are almost silent (if you’ve used a cheap mouse that has LOUD clicks you’ll know what I’m talking about, haha) and it’s very reactive. I use it for light gaming and it’s perfect. I haven’t even had to charge it yet, which is amazing. Absolutely worth it for the price!!",87,2.0,2021,10,October,26

great buy,2,"As I've just learned by searching questions, after using it for a few weeks, the scroll wheel stops working. Also, these are silly lights for a grownup.

Short life,2, I bought one of these from this company and it stopped working within the first 2 weeks.I messaged the seller upset because I could not return. I thought maybe buying the “upgraded” version would be best option before making a large complaint because it was a nice mouse for the little time I was able to use it.Big mistake.The second one stopped working within 2 weeks of using it continuously.I can’t return if either to receive my money back or receive a replacement.It’s frustrating because of the fact that I work from home and need a mouse.I am going to make a complaint through Amazon itself. But i wanted to warn others not to waist your money.Good luck!,118,3.0,2021,10,October,24

quiet clicking,2,"It's a cool mouse, the led features are nice and it's pretty, but I hate when I have to move it sporadically for a good 3-5 seconds before the mouse moves on the screen. I've tried different mouse pads, and it still happens. It's extremely frustrating, and it happens as soon as you stop using for any period of time and go back to using it. You have to left and right click numerous times before it will respond now. It also makes an irritating high-pitched noise when you move it.",91,5.0,2021,10,October,22
very laggy and the battery sucks,6,"I have now purchased 2 of these computer mice, both of which have broken and become unusable within just a few weeks. With the first one, I thought I got a defective item, so I returned it and got the same model again for exchange. Now that one has broken too, conveniently just 2 days outside the return window.  In both instances, the click wheel stopped functioning, making scrolling impossible. These were handled with care in my home office, and not used improperly, or dropped, or exposed to moisture, etc. They just seem very cheaply made. The LED lights were a nice feature but meaningless without a functioning mouse. As far as the ergonomics, I often found my hand hurting. The mouse is so low-profile as to be unnatural to hold or maneuver. I do not recommend this product.",139,2.0,2021,10,October,22
Very Solid Mouse,3,This mouse is unusable for someone who wishes to work efficiently. It tracks completely erratically and is simply not worth using.,21,5.0,2021,10,October,22
"Doesn't seem to charge, such a bummer.",7,"Great item overall, but I wish it uses usb c to charge then micro usb.",15,1.0,2021,10,October,22
Cheap,1,The mouse I got would make the pointer on the computer move without me moving the mouse and it constantly tried red even when it was on the rainbow setting and fully charged,33,1.0,2021,10,October,22
Works great,2,"Initially, I was pleased with the feel and performance of this mouse. It is lighter and slimmer than the typical usb wireless mouse, and it worked well. However, after about two weeks, the scrolling wheel became erratic and it stopped working altogether today, a bit more than three weeks in use. As a result, the mouse became essentially useless and I am returning it.",64,5.0,2021,10,October,22
Felt like a cheap piece of junk the moment I brought it out of the box.,16,"I love this mouse! It’s small and very quiet. The LED lights are a plus. I got the pink one and it couldn’t be any cuter!! Definitely will buy again, need one at home and work :)",37,1.0,2021,10,October,22

Right click stopped working 5 months after i bought it,10,Had this mouse less than a week. My kids knocked it off my desk. The mouse broke in half and will not snap back together. Has no durability! Save your money and buy a more reputable brand. My prior mouse was dropped dozens of times with no issues. Will be ordering one from that brand. This one is not worth the money.,62,1.0,2021,10,October,21
USB Broke,2,This stopped working after a month. Even after charging it won’t turn on.,13,1.0,2021,10,October,21
good quality,2,Worked flawlessly for a few days then the left button became  unreliable. Not worth the hassle to return.Update: Seller emailed me saying that they had corrected the problem and offered a refund if I took down this review.

Good basic RGB wireless mouse,5,"I bought this yesterday to replace a broken mouse. Day 1, has incredibly noticeable lag. I fully charged it before using it. It runs about the same as a turtle stuck in syrup. This isn't worth $15, just buy a different mouse.Update: The brand behind this sent me an email from a shady address claiming to be ""Amazon Custom Service"" and offered me $20 to delete the review. Not a chance. I urge you to stay away from this brand, they're shady af. They'll try to scam you after you buy their scummy product.",94,4.0,2021,10,October,21

Good product,2,Has worked great until now.  I charged it and now it won't turn back on.  Can't return it either.  Not worth the money.,23,4.0,2021,10,October,19
It doesn’t work correctly connection is bad,7,It is not response at all. It is very jerky and doesn’t react for several seconds. I have used several cordless mice before but this gets the thumbs down.,29,1.0,2021,10,October,19
This mouse looks nice and works well,7,"Update 02.24.2022: I'm not sure why, but this mouse is working better than it did when I originally purchased it back in October 2021.  I use it EVERY DAY and I don't mind charging it over night every couple of days or so.  It IS comfortable to use, and kind of funky (in a good way) to use the changing lights feature from time to time.  Naturally, this will make the battery run down faster, but once in a while I enjoy the light show...  LOL and I love how the ""click"" is SO QUIET!They say they've upgraded this product so I hope you'll give it a try too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Review October 2021:  My use of this mouse consists of following:6 hours of use (without the pretty little alternating lights on) and then it's switched off for the night.Before my next 6 hours are over, this thing runs out of life and must be charged again.I'm not at all thrilled with it.It does have a nice quiet click, but if I have to charge it every time I use it, I don't think it will last very long....",187,5.0,2021,10,October,19
Does the job,3,Its worth the price. Really good quality. Easy to install. Very smooth and works perfect. Highly recommend it.,18,5.0,2021,10,October,19

My kids love them ❤,5,The cursor acts erratically and the left and right buttons respond poorly. One must work twice as hard to use this than any other mouse I have ever had. Seek elsewhere - go to a local store where you can easily return the thing if you need to.,48,5.0,2021,10,October,18
Incredibly bad tracking and review manipulation,6,"People always ask me about my mouse when I use it at school. Love the colors, love that its rechargeable.

Did not help me at all,6,"The mouse checks all my needs: wireless,  low profile, and inexpensive.I used to have a roller ball mouse but found myself having to frequently clean the ball from lint and dirt so this is a vast improvement.I've used this for a few days now and haven't had to charge it yet so so far so solid.",56,1.0,2021,10,October,18
Very Cheap Junk Don't Believe High Ratings,7,"I wanted to just like it . I mean it worked. But, honestly, it felt like a kids cheap dollar tree toy. I just can’t imagine that it will last long. I should have known better, with the price. Anyway, I returned it.",43,1.0,2021,10,October,18

amazing,1,"I purchased this in July and it worked perfectly. It's now ""ass backwards"" You have to hold the button down just in order to move the cursor. If I let go of the button  IT DOES NOTHING. Its completely off track. The LED only works when it's charging. Before it worked whenever it was on the last switch  on the bottom of the mouse.",64,5.0,2021,10,October,17

My LED Mouse is Mousing and I love it!,9,"I bought this mouse specifically for its price and slim profile. I wanted something small and compact that is easy to pack in my laptop bag. This fits the bill.This mouse is perfect for everyday use such as going to websites, using office applications like word, excel and powerpoint etcI would not recommend the mouse for gaming purposes, and that is not what it is meant for anyway.If you want a mouse that works for web browsing/office work on the go, looks nice and is slim and compact get this device!",91,5.0,2021,10,October,17

Quality,1,"This is a very nice mouse for the price. The charge in the battery lasts a long time and the mouse buttons make almost no noise whatsoever. Perfect for use during a lecture at school when you don’t want to disturb the speaker with incessant clicking noises. I’m not sure how this would be for gamers, but the switchable DPI is a very nice feature, as well.Also, I do feel that I should point out that the RGB lights are switchable on and off, which is a nice feature if you are like me and are in a class where the room goes dark for presentations and video clips.",109,1.0,2021,10,October,16
would not recommend.,3,I bought this mouse back in July to use with my laptop when I was in class. This would equate to a few hours each week.

Customer Service,2,"When I first received the mouse it worked well and I enjoyed the multi-colors.  However, after 1 month it constantly needed to be charged.  By three months it no longer cycled the different colors, but was only red.  Now at the 7 month mark it no longer tracks, I move the mouse but my cursor doesn't move on the screen.  I've never had a mouse go bad this quickly.  I will not be purchasing this mouse again.",77,5.0,2021,10,October,14

Sleep and Comfortable,3,"Got the mouse hooked up and at first it didn't work. Light up but rgb function and connection to pc didn't work. Figured out it needed to sit and fully charge for everything to work. Mouse was doing great until I found a issue with its sleep mode. When the mouse falls asleep to save battery, it wakes up very quickly. However from that point on its control over the cursor becomes delayed. It's ping is tripled and you can watch the cursor stick and then start to move again while moving the mouse. I turned the mouse off and back on again to resolve this problem. So the sleep feature on this mouse is terrible. Have to turn it on and off as needed.",125,5.0,2021,10,October,13
Works great quick pairing,4,"I bought these for my classroom, I have Sixteen total. They are constantly connecting to each others receivers and some just losing connection and not reconnecting after sleep mode.

Perfect!,1,Worst wireless mouse I have ever purchased.  The lag time to respond to movement is horrble.  Clicking is even worse.  Sometimes I have to click three or four times before the mouse works.  I tried on multiple systems just to be sure it was not an issue with one laptop.  Do not purchase.  A complete waste of money and time.,60,5.0,2021,10,October,11
Works very well,3,I really wanted to like this mouse as it’s lightweight and cute but it’s not worth it when the mouse charge dies quickly and since it’s not compatible with my MacBook I can’t use it while charging since I have to use the same adapter for both sensor and charging.

Good cheap mouse,3,"I loved this mouse. It was slick and easy to use. However it was not once I used on a regular basis. I only used it may 1 hour max each day.

Good rechargeable mouse,3,"Nice low silhouette and quiet action. Does what is expected of a mouse and is good looking to boot. Obviously cannot judge it’s ergonomic qualities from such a short term of usage, but it appears to be no strain at all on my wrist and fingers. Holds a charge well. The only caveat I might mention is that the dongle is a bit too short for if you’re using while charging, but that is a minor issue. Well pleased with this mouse.",82,5.0,2021,10,October,09

All around great mouse,4,I work from home and have to run more than one screen and this mouse was amazing when I bought it. Now it has decided that it doesn’t want to charge and is currently useless after only 5 week. I was about to buy another one for my mom but have canceled it now since this one has stopped working. It sucks because it’s such a fun mouse. It also never leaves my home office so I know it’s not from packing or moving it around a lot,88,5.0,2021,10,October,08
Works,1,"The mouse is ergonomically comfortable and I like the cool lights. However, difficult to enjoy these features when the mouse doesn’t work. The first one had a defective left click button.

Choppy and disconnection issues,4,I purchased this mouse to replace the corded mouse in my office.  I have used it for a little over a week now and am completely satisfied with the way it works and how my hand feels.  Ergonomically speaking it is so much better than the standard chunkier mouses I've used most of my professional career.  My hand is in a resting position while using it and remains free from stress and strain. LOVE IT!,75,1.0,2021,10,October,06
Not working,2,"It works perfectly in my MacBook proupdate: now it does not work anymore, very disappointed",15,1.0,2021,10,October,05
BEWARE Does not hold charge.,5,"I will quickly touch on the star ranking then get into it. Ergonomics, feels good in my hand at first but after a few minutes you start to realize something is off. It’s a little too small for extended use. But hey, that’s personal preference. For the couple hours I did use this thing The sleep mode worked. I did zero gaming with it because the basic task of trying to pull up Netflix and Hulu was a nightmare. The quiet click is top notch. I’d give that 5 outta 5.So I’ve had glitchy mice before and it was annoying but could deal with it for a little bit. They might twitch a little or maybe vibrate some when the mouse wasn’t being used. But this thing full jumps across the screen and not even in the right direction always. I use a split screen and i open Netflix on the left screen and it pops up open on the right. When I move the mouse to the right it starts to move then jumps and ends up all the way back to the left. It also lags every once in a while and sometimes you put the mouse over something. Leave it there for a second to make sure you are on what you want to click on and when you click it actually clicks on 2 rows above where I was (this was on Netflix’s). This is a nightmare of a mouse. Do Not Buy! Its a cheap mouse but not even the cheapest option. You can buy a cheaper mouse that functions properly. The LED lights did work just fine for me. The next morning I went back to using my mouse that is duct taped together until I can get another one.",296,1.0,2021,10,October,05
"Great product, excellent seller!",4,"Have been using the Wireless Mouse now for a few months and it is a Great purchase.  After charging, it works for days; also the speed is fantastic!  I would highly recommend buying item.",34,5.0,2021,10,October,05
Didn't Work at all,4,"Just like the title says, died out of nowhere 20 days after the return window and warranty were up. I tired it on two PCs and one laptop. It still lights up, but won't connect. JUNK!",36,1.0,2021,10,October,05
Complete junk!,2,Mouse was very light and would t keep a charge. Adapter broke a week after I got it.,18,1.0,2021,10,October,05
Buy a different mouse,4,Doesn't hold charge very long.  Hard to click - use.  Stopped working all together.  Have gone back to wired mouse.  Much easier to use.,24,1.0,2021,10,October,05
only lasted maybe 40 uses,5,This mouse is wonderful and easy to use without a mouse pad which is a big plus. Bought this to replace my old wireless mouse because the usb plug is shorter and does't stick out the side of my laptop to far. It is rechargeable and lasts for a while thanks to the sleep function which is easy to exit from. Love that you can choose to have it light up and changes colors. Totally worth the buy!,78,1.0,2021,10,October,05
"Don't waste your money, keep scrolling and purchase a different one.",11,Used this mouse for a week and the scroll roller is already broken.,13,1.0,2021,10,October,05
Worst Mouse Ever,3,I hate this mouse. Doesn’t stay charged and sleep mode kicks in too quickly,14,1.0,2021,10,October,05
Stopped working on day 31!!!!,5,"I was impressed with the first 2 I’ve bought for my boys, had to get a 3rd for myself. No problems connect mouse to my laptop, love the lights on it. Easy to glide, easy to use",37,1.0,2021,10,October,05

Does what it is supposed to do...and looks cool doing it,11,"After 2 weeks it just completely stopped working. Tried 4 different chargers and nothing. It was a good price and loved the lights, but should have just grabbed one from the dollar store if this is the quality of the product😑",41,5.0,2021,10,October,05
Comfortable and I like the lighting but scroll wheel has quit working after 2-1/2 months,15,"Came ready to use, starting using straight from box. It is convenient, and ergonomic friendly.",15,3.0,2021,10,October,04
Stopped working after 1 day,5,Of course 2 weeks after return window closes the mouse stops working. Slow movement and doesn’t respond to commands. Waste of plastic.UPDATE: Seller offered to make this right.  Awaiting final resolution,31,1.0,2021,10,October,04
Scroll doesn’t work,3,I like this wireless mouse for now. Hoping nothing goes wrong with it. So far it's been very dependable and works correctly. The design is perfect and I love the different colors. It works the moment you connect the USB connector to the computer and turn the mouse on. The only thing I don't like is how quickly it goes into sleep mode. But that's not too big of an annoyance.,71,1.0,2021,10,October,04
Great mouse,2,"The mouse just feels odd in my hand. It's serviceable, but when it dies I'm not buying another.",18,5.0,2021,10,October,04
DOESN'T WORK FOR LONG!! DON'T BUY!!!,6,After 2 months of using this mouse it just stopped working out of nowhere and it’s fully charged. Also experience the random jumping of the cursor before it left this life and went to mouse heaven. Would no recommend.,39,1.0,2021,10,October,04
USB Port breaks easily.,4,"I love that it change colors. It’s sleek, and easy to control. I will most definitely order another one.",19,2.0,2021,10,October,04

Very Good For Daily Computer Activities,6,Just what I needed and I like the colors. Real sleek in hand,13,5.0,2021,10,October,04
No longevity,2,"***Update 12/10/21*** This mouse is garbage. I wrote my review after one day of good functionality, but the rechargeable battery seems to only last one day before it starts being jerky and responding inconsistently, buttons don't always work when I click something. If I take out the USB and turn on/off the mouse it fixes it for a few minutes until it goes into sleep mode. The first one they sent me didn't work at all and this new one just doesn't work. It works better if the mouse is plugged in but the cord is short and stiff. Ordering something else.The mouse works great for my Dell laptop. Fits comfortably, sleek profile, no problems. The button is still audible but quieter than my last mouse. I had an issue with my first shipment, but customer service was very responsive, problem-solved with me, and then shipped me a new mouse very quickly.",152,1.0,2021,10,October,04
Moves smoothly,2,"This mouse is good for its price. Its light, and the clicking mechanism is actually quite nice. When you press down it's more of a subtle, soft click which I like a lot, rather than an annoying and loud click. However, it does feel a little cheap when you hold it and quality of the plastic is pretty low. When using the LED mode you can practically see inside the mouse. Once again though, for $15, it's not bad! I like it because I can connect it to my Macbook air too, which uses an USB-C.",96,5.0,2021,10,October,04
Does not work,3,"I love the sleek design of this mouse.  My favorite aspect, though, is the quiet clicking - the noise is muted and that is an unexpected bonus!",27,1.0,2021,10,October,03

Great,1,"Broke after one month, went to plug it in and the charging port pushed way back inside the mouse and when I opened the mouse up to fix it the piece had busted off completely.",35,5.0,2021,10,October,03
Charge lasts long,3," In all honesty, there is very little practical value added by colorful light changes for a mouse, but you know what?  In this time of the pandemic, we can all use a bit of quirky and interesting little patches of fun and joy -- especially visually.  This little mouse (I got the gold color because it was the least expensive at the time) always brings a smile.  Btw, it IS quiet -- no noisy clicks, the color is beautiful and classic, and the feel is very ergonomic and no stress on the hand and fingers. If you're still on the fence -- get one (or more) if you want to give yourself a little (and very useful) treat.",118,3.0,2021,10,October,03
Not Macbook Compatible,3,I've had this about a month and it's struggling to hold a charge and the mouse is jumping. There is also no option to return!! I'll be going back to a regular battery operated one as rechargeable is just not reliable. Dissapointed!,42,1.0,2021,10,October,02
It's ok...,2,"I work from home and in the office.  I have to transport my laptop and mouse.  I have forgotten my mouse more time that I can remember at the office.  I bought 2 of these so I can keep 1 at home and 1 at the office.  They only hold a charge for less than a week.  It might have to do with it having lights on it, but my other mouse holds a charge of heavy usage for a month.  Will not buy again as I need something to hold a charge much longer.",95,3.0,2021,10,October,02
Short battery life.,3,Exactly what I was looking for. Sleek and quiet and also pretty with the lights! You can turn the rainbow lights off if you don’t want them on.,28,3.0,2021,10,October,02
awful,1,"I was used to buying name brand 'mouses'.  And I was worried about the size of this device. But actually its a good size just with a lower profile.  Works very well and sleeps and wakes up when you push the button on top.  The lighting is nice, not real bright but just a strip around the outside and the button lights up.  Changes color which is a nice touch.  So I actually like it better than the other larger mouses I have.",83,1.0,2021,10,October,02
Poor tracking,2,"You get what you pay for. If you just need a quick mouse on the go so you don’t need a touch pad, this is great. Enduring use of everyday mouse, spend the money for one that is lightweight, ventilated, ergonomic, or a combination. This one, soft clicks, decent feedback, good battery. Just not super high quality for the desk job",61,1.0,2021,10,October,01

constantly have it plugged in,5,"So I bought two different mouse to use, one for my laptop and one for my pc. The originally bought this one for my desktop to match my RGB but I enjoy using it with my laptop much better. It is the perfect size for my hand. You cannot go wrong at this price for what you get! I enjoy the noiseless aspect and the light weight feel.",68,3.0,2021,09,September,30
the usb adapter,3,Bought the rose gold one to match my laptop and while it's not a perfect match it's still very pretty and I love the lights! It is a very silent when clicking and very responsive when moving the mouse.Update:So I received this mouse exactly 10 days ago and the scroll button is broke. I went to try to take it apart to fix it and even with the correct size screwdriver (Very small btw) it just stripped the screw because it was so tightly screwed in. so not only did my brand new less than 2 week old mouse break they made it impossible to fix it by making a fort nox screw. not happy save your money.,118,1.0,2021,09,September,29
compatible with my macbook!,4,"It does everything I ordered it to do for a good price. rechargeability is a huge plus to me for a wireless mouse, the clicks are satisfying, and it feels nice to hold. My only gripe is that the lights on it are a bit weak, but I honestly don't care about that in the slightest and that's not why I bought it so it's not a big deal.",69,5.0,2021,09,September,29
works well,2,"PERFECT,  no complaints. Super cute color changes. I never charge it and it's only died once and I use it for work about 10 hours a day and seems like I charge it like 2 times a week.",38,5.0,2021,09,September,29

Chinese CE marked device; not a real CE mark,9,Worked great after first charge then became choppy and uncontrollable. Very disappointed in this mouse.,15,1.0,2021,09,September,29
This is crap.  It would not hold a charge!!!!,9,My mouse has stop working already. I had the mouse for two months and already it has stop working. This was a waste of money.,25,1.0,2021,09,September,29
Awesome but squeaky,3,I have two problems. No matter how long you charge it for it’s dead in an hour. That’s if it been works.  The usb plug in takes two people to get out and I’m afraid it will get stuck and ruin my computer.  The appearance is great but it doesn’t work and could break the USB port. Because of this I do not recommend.Since this posted the company offered 40$ To change review instead of just sending another mouse. Clearly they know there product does not work.,87,3.0,2021,09,September,29

Great,1,"This mouse is very cheaply made and did not function properly right out of the box. It will move the cursor around and scroll, but it will not click on anything, right or left click. Ridiculous! I want to return it, but the hassle of dealing with it isn’t worth getting the money back since it was so cheap to begin with. Should have known to go for a more expensive and reputable brand like Logitech!",76,4.0,2021,09,September,29
worked for three days,4,"After just three months, this mouse no longer charges. So, it's useless. Spend a few extra dollars and get a better mouse.",22,1.0,2021,09,September,29

Great mouse for a great price,6,"It was so pretty for the first few hours after charging with the changing lights and standby light mode.  Then the next morning after turning it off, it would not turn back on, so I put it on the charging cord... for DAYS!!! and nope nothing.... Save your money and purchase something else and make sure it takes batteries.  This is garbage that has a pretty face on it.  If i still had the box it came in I would be getting a full refund and send it back.",89,5.0,2021,09,September,28

DO NOT BUY  - DIED IN 2 MONTHS,8,Enjoy the mouse.,3,1.0,2021,09,September,27
Doesn’t work!,2,"I needed a mouse for my laptop. For around the same price as a ""big name"" mouse you can get a mouse that works just as well. And looks cool with it's LED lights. And it's rechargeable. The lights can be switched off if they are too distracting but i admit I like them. It isn't quite as ergonomic as some mice but it fits nicely into my laptop bag.  USB receiver is small enough to leave in my laptop without it getting yanked out.",85,1.0,2021,09,September,27
Good mouse,2,I like the look and feel of this mouse. It is clean and fits my hand well. My complaint is with the working of it. After only 2-1/2 months the scroll wheel has quit working. About 4 weeks ago it began with the cursor jumping when I pulled down on the wheel but now it only barely works. I pull down on the wheel and either nothing happens at all or the line on the page jumps down one line and then stops altogether. I will see if I can get it fixed or replaced but this was a new item and should have worked a year or more without issues. It makes me very sad.,116,5.0,2021,09,September,26
Mouse is pretty great,4,Piece of junk. Stopped working after 1 day. Now the only way for the cursor to move is if you hold down the right mouse button. How is that even possible? Did the mouse rewire itself? Not sure how this product is so highly rated.,45,5.0,2021,09,September,26
It’s good but not worth it,6,The scroll wheel doesn’t work,5,3.0,2021,09,September,26

Don’t buy!!!,2,"I have purchased this mouse twice and each time it has phased out on me after about 2-3 months of use. It stopped holding a charge and I cold only use it while it was plugged in which defeats the meaning of wireless. Then it completely went out on me and I can no longer use the mouse at all even when it is on the charging cable. I have gone through the customer reviews looking for fixes and nothing.Update: Now I'm being offered money to remove my comment. $40-45. No I will not. I can care less about my money back I want what I paid for and a refund shouldn't be contigent upon removing my comment. Again, don't buy.",121,1.0,2021,09,September,26
Not Good!,2,The mouse itself still works but the USB port has just broken in a million pieces. My laptop stays at home and it is what I use as my home computer. After about a month of use the USB port is just the piece that pushes into the laptop and the plastic tip is just gone. One more break and it will either be stuck in my computer or I will be unable to use the mouse.,77,1.0,2021,09,September,25
Dont waist your money,4,"Was a great mouse until it stopped working, which was less than 2 months after I purchased it.  It was used and charged as per instructions, then it suddenly stopped functioning all together.  Would not purchase again, because even with its low cost, it's not worth it to only get 2 months use out of it.  Do not recommend.",59,1.0,2021,09,September,25
Poor quality,2,"It works well looks pretty and very smooth to use, good buy",12,1.0,2021,09,September,25
Didn't work,2,"i think this mouse is great! I love the LED colors changing. It goes to sleep after a little while to save battery life. It's very simple to charge if it ever needs it. My only thing about it (and it's not even negative about the device) is that my hands are very big so this seems a little tinier than I'd like. Still though, I got no complaints about it.",71,1.0,2021,09,September,25
not responding fast,3,"Bought this mouse for work because I didn't want to use the corded mouse my company gave me.Not even two months in, the mouse scroller BREAKS.

Loses connection frequently,3,The design is pretty but the functionality is crappy. My mouse censor keeps glitching in and out which makes it impossible to work with. Definitely will be returning which is really annoying because it took forever to arrive and it was supposed to be a replacement for my previous wireless mouse that fell to its death from the 2nd floor last week.,62,3.0,2021,09,September,24
Clunky sliding,2,"For the money, this mouse is a great value! I needed a new mouse, as the click on my old brand name mouse was begging to ""miss"".  I wanted something fairly inexpensive, wireless and rechargeable. I am tired of having to switch out batteries. This mouse fit all those perfectly.  My first month impression is .. it's excellent.  After the initial charge, it's still going strong with maybe an hour a day usage, after 3 weeks.  It goes to ""sleep"" after a period of inactivity, which helps to conserve the battery.  My only gripe, would be the slim profile.  I think I prefer a little more bulk in my palm.  My only contact with the mouse when navigating, is with my fingers, no palm contact.  This does not deduct from my rating as it is clearly advertised as a slim profile design.  All in.. I am glad I purchased this mouse.  If this company develops a full contoured model, I would surely upgrade.",163,1.0,2021,09,September,24

Lasted 2 months,3,"At first I really loved this mouse - fast connection and worked well. But like several other reviews mentioned, after about 8-9 months, it just stopped working. It didn’t charge or anything, it just literally stopped working. For that alone, I would rate it a bad pedi to because it doesn’t last. I didn’t drop it or beak it, it simply stopped working.",63,2.0,2021,09,September,23

He loves it!,3,"The item is actually nice. The size, color and lights are very cute. And I love that is rechargeable. The only issue I encounter was that when you leave it idle for a few seconds and then try to use it, it gets super slow and lags. I have to turn it off and back on to have the speed back to normal.

AND they are not cheap by any means!!So disappointed in Amazon allowing this product to be sold on their site. I have never been so distraught with any of my purchases with Amazon EVER - BUT THIS ONE really places shame on Amazon.I would like full replacement for both because I have TWO work PCS for my job; one for the USA and another PC for accounts out of the country (Latin America) - that was the purpose for purchasing two.,112,1.0,2021,09,September,22

Amazing!,1,"I bought this mouse a few months ago, and the USB receiver broke. However, I contacted the seller about the issue, and they sent me a new mouse, at no cost.",31,5.0,2021,09,September,20

Very comfortable,2,I absolutely love how vibrant the lights are and how light weight the mouse is. I work from home and use this alot.,23,5.0,2021,09,September,20
Don't waste your money.,4,If you had that I've never ending need to have a wireless mouse that has led colors on it that needs to be constantly plugged in for it to work then this is for you.  The charge on it will last approximately 7 hours before it's dead.  If you turn off the pretty lights then maybe it will last 12 hours.  Really not a functional wireless mouse.  Don't buy it.,70,1.0,2021,09,September,20

This is an improvement from the first model. It’s really good and cool.,13,"This mouse worked well for a while (3-4 months) but now it is very unreliable. I switched USB ports, got an extender thinking the connector was blocked by my metal desk. 🤷‍♀️That helped some, but it lags, and the click only works about half the time. I have a classroom full of first graders who are waiting on my silly mouse to get it together so I can show them the next slide or open the video for them. It has been SUPER frustrating. I will be purchasing another brand.",90,5.0,2021,09,September,19
Love it!,2,It was very helped,4,5.0,2021,09,September,19
Never worked. Might be the adapter.,6,Only have had this mouse for 2 months and already have to replace it. The charging port on the mouse no longer staying in place and therefore not charging.

died after a month,4,"Finally, a sleep mode that is done right! ALL my other wireless mice when they go to sleep you have to click to wake, pretty standard. Well, when I wake those other mice with a right or left click it is a active click. Which means it acts as if it was never asleep and either opens a menu or activates what I clicked. Always frustrated me LOL!Well this one is super nice, you click and it's awake without doing an activation or selection. I have been looking for this in a wireless mouse and have finally found it!Also, it has a nice feel, not super ergonomic, but nice. The color selection is nice, I chose the grey. The RGB lights are very pleasant to the eyes. I haven't had it long enough to rate the length of the internal rechargeable battery but I will update soon. The cable that comes with the mouse is very short, but that isn't a problem. The DBI variety is nice as well. Very happy with this mouse!",174,1.0,2021,09,September,19

Would rather use rechargeable batteries.",65,1.0,2021,09,September,18

Stop working after a few months,6,I needed a new mouse because the one I had been using was so old and was unreliable. This new one is so nice for such a great price!

Love it.,2,I use this all day during work and then I use it to play the sims I the evening or on the weekend. It charges quickly and the battery lasts so long.

Stopped working after one month,5,I am really happy with the purchase of this mouse. I had been looking for a good mouse that cheap and wireless. This is the best fit. I am able to carry this everywhere and has long lasting battery. Also the range of the Bluetooth is really good because I was able to control my computer while I was another room,61,1.0,2021,09,September,14
Doesn't work,2,"This mouse is quiet as advertised, so it's nice as someone sleeps in my office while I do schoolwork most of the time. The sleep mode on it is nice, but I feel it triggers too soon. That being said, it's bothersome, but not a deal breaker. I was concerned about the quality upon receiving it as it is quite light and feels cheaply made (I'm sure it is), but it's traveled in my laptop case quite successfully without incident, knock on wood. I'm sure if dropped or enough pressure was put on it, it could very well break or crack, but if you treat it well, I don't see why this mouse shouldn't last you. I've had it for about a month now and the only thing I can complain about is the sleep timer, so take that as you will.",142,1.0,2021,09,September,14
"junk, broke after 2 weeks and sensitivity is supper high for its lowest mode",14,I got this mouse for work. It works great however it needs to be charged and unfortunately it can’t be used with battery it’s only usb charger so the only down side of this if u work with it for 4-5 days u will need to charge it or it will die on u and u have to keep charging it in ur laptop to keep using it! It’s unfortunately not for me and I don’t like how it doesn’t have battery or dies fast!,85,1.0,2021,09,September,13
"A colorful, sparkly mouse that goes to sleep!",8,"With the price, I was skeptical, but this mouse really does work well.

I highly recommend it.",54,5.0,2021,09,September,13

It is so cute!,4,"I waited a while to leave a review. I tought it would last, but it didn't. It was really smooth and long lasting battery. Little did i know while using it it would become apart internally. The scrollwheel broke. I usually fix my electronics easily, sometimes things just need a little adjustment but, this part broke and with no fixing. Maybe some of you are lucky and doesn't break easily. Mine did and not even 3 weeks of using it.",80,5.0,2021,09,September,13

Get disconnected easily,3,I purchased this mouse to use with a chrome book. It pairs well and I have no complaints.

I would totally try more of their products.,53,4.0,2021,09,September,13
It works,2,"Adorable little mouse...however...the darn thing will be on and won't do anything. I know to click to wake it (if it's in sleep mode) but half the time it won't be asleep and I have to click like 5 times for it to start actually working. Unfortunately, I'll have to find another mouse because this has become an irritating inconvenience.",60,5.0,2021,09,September,13

Poor Dongle Placement,3,"The ergonomics are good, but it has a fatal flaw that makes it unusable.  When you first turn it on, it works fine.  But after 5 minutes or so, it becomes very ""twitchy"" or""jerky"" and completely unusable.I tried it on both Macs and PCs.  Same problem with both systems.It's too cheap to bother sending back, but I want to warn others not to make the same mistake.",67,2.0,2021,09,September,12

FUNCTIONAL & FREAKING CUTE!,4,I didn't know it was possible to like a mouse so much! It is very comfortable and smooth. The battery life is pretty long. I don't like having to charge it because sometimes I forget to plug it in and then it goes dead. The battery life usually last around a week. As long as I can remember to charge it it is fantastic.,64,5.0,2021,09,September,11

Doesnt last,2,"I ordered this mouse.  I really liked it - It was slim, fit nicely in my hand and I loved how the lights changed colors.  After a few months, there was a problem with it.  When the company found out they gladly refunded me my purchase price with no questions asked.  Great customer service.  I would order it again after dealing with them if I hadn't already bought another mouse because I had work to finish.  I give them 5 stars",81,1.0,2021,09,September,10
Can’t hold charge,3,Straight out of the package I had issues but figured I would hold on. The mouse does not move smoothly. Cannot click on things and then the mouse would move only intermittenly. Then it would stop and I would have to jerk it around.. and now it has just stopped. Just upgrade ... spend a little more on a logi mouse and it is worth it.,66,1.0,2021,09,September,10

Didn’t hold well,3,"I didn't like the way the light shown thru the top, like the plastic was super thin and semi-transparent and it didn't come thru evenly. I have been using it for a while now and it sometimes gives me trouble. I have to tap the bottom to get the red light back on and the wheel stops working sometimes. Just unplug USB and plug back in fixes it. Still 5 stars because at this price it's great!",77,1.0,2021,09,September,08
Find a different mouse to buy,6," Works well until it goes into sleep mode.  When you wake it up the cursor is incredibly laggy and skips around.  The only way to get that to stop is to turn it off and then back on. Which seems minuscule, but it gets really annoy the longer you use it.Maybe I just got a defective one? It's got some really high marks... but buyer beware.Video shows it being woken up, then I turn it off/on and it works fine.",80,1.0,2021,09,September,08

Worked for short time,4,Needed a wireless mouse for a work laptop and this mouse gets the job done. The price is very affordable and the product came very fast.

Would recommend this mouse if anyone is trying to find something for their Macbook (USB C port).,63,1.0,2021,09,September,05

AMAZING mouse!! No issues and everything I was looking for,10,The USB port broke inside my work laptop after only using this wireless mouse for 2 days.

After a few minutes of use, it would lose connection.",52,3.0,2021,08,August,31
Works well,2,"I wanted to find a slim, wireless mouse similar to a Mac's magic mouse, without the high price tag. While this certainly *isn't* a magic mouse, it's a pretty good substitute for a fraction of the cost. There are some tradeoffs of course, due to the slim nature of this mouse - it is extremely lightweight (i.e. not built like a tank) and sometimes the buttons require a sturdy click to ensure a response. But, all in all, I'm happy with my purchase. It looks nice, works well and it has gone about 2 months so far without needing a recharge. Speaking of which...I leave the mouse on all the time and it goes into sleep mode. No big deal, just realize you need to click a button to wake it up once you power on your laptop or desktop. Otherwise, it will seem like the mouse isn't working. Also, I've had a couple of instances where I had to reinsert the USB adapter to get it to reconnect. But, that was maybe 2 times in the past couple of months.In short, I recommend this product. The company provided great support when I received the wrong color mouse and they've been top-notch to deal with. They stand behind their product.",210,5.0,2021,09,September,03

Charge port,2,"I really liked this mouse, being able to charge it and not worry about batteries, was working great up till today.  I tried to pull the wireless usb from the chromebook and it only partially came out.  The cover to it was still stuck inside the port.  I had to use tools to get it out and now it’s no longer usable.  Very upset, I have a lot of work I have to get done and using a mouse makes it smoother to navigate. Guess this would happen just after 2 weeks of the return window closing.  I have only had this since the end of July 2021.",108,1.0,2021,09,September,02
Charging cable is WAY TOO SHORT,6,"This mouse is so hard to use that I’m scrolling my documents with the keyboard arrow keys. Push the left button 10 times, it might place the cursor, select the word or do nothing, depends on the mouse gods. If you leave the mouse arrow over the cursor when you FINALLY get it where you want and if you type, nothing happens.This thing is trash. Buying a Logitech mouse to replace.",71,1.0,2021,09,September,01

stopped working after one week!,5,The mouse is fine for typical home use but the dongle drives me crazy. I remove it from my laptop when it's not in use and put it back under the mouse.

Not Impresses,2,"The mouse drags, after I use for like an hour, battery does not last too long, it takes longer to charge then the amount of time been use. Will not buy. Look for better quality name brand. I do not recomend at all. I wish I can get my money back",51,2.0,2021,08,August,31

Broke after only a couple weeks,6,It broke after 4 weeks.,5,3.0,2021,08,August,30
broken after the 2nd week,5,Wish I hadn't missed the return window on this one. This mouse does not have a range of 10 meters as stated. It has difficulty tracking at just 1 meter (or even a couple of feet) away. This was supposed to replace a mouse from another seller that I also had trouble with. It turned out to be the same exact mouse. It's disheartening to find out that multiple companies are selling the same useless products. I would recommend spending a little more money on a mouse from a reputable brand.,91,1.0,2021,08,August,30
miss leading,2,Just stopped working after 2 weeks,6,1.0,2021,08,August,30
Stopped working,2,"I loved this product for a couple of weeks, but after is ran out of juice the FIRST time and I charged it overnight, it hasn't worked again.  I CANNOT recommend this product.

Good product,2,"Loved the look and feel of this mouse, but after only 4 weeks of school, the USB completely came apart when I pulled it out of my son's Chromebook.

Long battery life; great mouse,5,It quit working after less than 2 months. Ugh!  It’s no wonder they only have a 30 day return policy.,20,5.0,2021,08,August,30
Wireless Mouse,2,"I have been using the wireless mouse for 3 weeks.  I waited to write the review so I could truly review it based on my experience. It has not disappointed me, and I like everything about it.  I charge it whenever I remember to. The design is sleek, and the changing colors are soothing. When I take my eyes off the screen, I stare at the mouse. The respond to clicks is smooth, and quick. I can feel the clicks but not hear the clicks.",85,1.0,2021,08,August,30
Good value,2,Not bad. As expected for the price. Clicks a little loud when you click use it.,16,4.0,2021,08,August,30
This does not take batteries!,5,Not attractive when lit up — because the light leaks through the white shell. Just not attractive,17,2.0,2021,08,August,30
Great mouse for it's price,5,"I purchased this mouse because it matched my laptop and seemed like it would look really attractive and cool when I was using it.It looked exactly like the mouse in the picture, and was easy to charge and use. It also held a charge for a long time which I was really happy about.The reason my review is so low is because my mouse only lasted for 2 months and then it completely stopped working no matter what I did. I certainly wasn't expecting a wireless mouse to last forever but it would have been nice to get at least 6 months out of it before it died.If you're looking for something cute and short-term and don't mind having to buy several mice every year this is the perfect purchase for you.",132,5.0,2021,08,August,29
Broke in a month,4,This mouse made my life easier honestly!!!!!,7,1.0,2021,08,August,29
Very Pleased,2,"Upon unpackaging the item, everything was as advertised and instructions were simple and easy to follow.  However, after a coupe of uses the battery was no longer holding a charge.  The light would turn on indicating that it was charging and a couple of minutes later, the light was off.  I told myself that maybe the mouse was charging even though the light was not on so I left it on to charge for a couple of hours.  Unfortunately, the mouse was not charging as it was already dead after five minutes of use.  I found myself using my laptop mouse more often then this mouse due to this.  Ergonomic design and lighting is great, but kind of useless given that the mouse did not fulfill its main purpose - 1 star.",132,5.0,2021,08,August,29

Cool accessory,2,"The USB plug broke after one use. I plugged it into my chromebook's USB port and when I went to remove it, the metal stayed in the laptop.

great mouse,2,"Wish the battery lasted longer. I seem to have to recharge it every month vs rechargeable batteries last me 6 months before I need to recharge. Otherwise, nice ergonomic shape and low enough to not affect the wrist. The optical sensor is not so great especially when battery is low.",50,5.0,2021,08,August,28

Didn’t work,2,"I liked it a lot at first, worked great. But after one week, it's not working properly.

Great for the week it worked.,6,"The battery of this mouse works well. I haven't timed it but I have left it on overnight and it stills has battery. I'm not a gamer but I imagine the gaming quality will be affected depending on how strong the bluetooth connection of the mouse is to the a PC setup. I recently switched from a laptop that had the standard rectangular port (USB-A) to one that needed the adapter (USB-C). The adapter that comes with the  mouse worked for about a minute before it stop functioning. So I brought out my own adapter (from a different device) and the mouse now works. I also tested both adapters with a wired mouse. It suffices to say that it was the mouse's adapter that is not working. I could have gotten a faulty one, so the problem could be exclusive to me.TL;DR - Mouse adapter didn't work. Ur screwed if urs doesn't work either and don't have an extra one.",160,1.0,2021,08,August,24

Yesterday (August 30th) the roller ball on top stopped working and now I can't scroll screens without using the sidebar. Very disappointed in how quickly this mouse stopped working. My grandmother always said you get what you pay for...and in this instance, she was 100% correct.",71,1.0,2021,08,August,23
Don't buy,2," I was actually about to return the mouse Bc it stopped working and I couldn’t  find where to replace the batteries.  Had thrown out the box and prob the instruction booklet (can’t remember if it actually came with instruction booklet).  Went to Amazon and read the product detail and saw that it’s a rechargeable mouse, using a USB cable.Like: it’s small, lightweight, and comfortable.  It fit perfectly in my hand and when resting on top of the mouse, the mouse didn’t feel bulky or heavy.Like: the colors changing - pretty coolLike:  not battery operated.  You can charge using a standard USB cable.Like and Dislike:  I read that there is a silent option to mute click sound - have not found it to test - but like that there is the option to take the mouse silent.  After trying to research how to make the mouse silent, I have still not been able to do so.Like (maybe)  great that there is a sleep mode- not sure where to find it or if I have, really cannot tell the difference.  The options in the back are OFF, ON, and something that looks like a SUN.  When on the “ON”option, I think (I think it’s in sleep mode Bc the light turns red and then turn off) but when on the “SUN”mode, the lights change.Dislike:  When using the mouse, at first, there are no issues.  This is the same experience if the mouse is used with USB cable or wireless.  Randomly, the mouse will then lag and get stuck.  Needed to turn power on and off a few times.Aside from the minor issue of latency and turning the mouse on and off, it’s ok.  I got this mouse as a second mouse Bc the original mouse I purchased was taken by my son.  It is def for the more “casual” user - surfing the internet or checking on EMs.  If trying to use for work, I’d get a mouse a little bit more sturdy and reliable.",333,1.0,2021,08,August,23

Disappointment,1,I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I don't like that anytime I stop using the mouse for a minute or two that the mouse doesn't react. I end up turning it off and on again to get it working. I'm interrupted frequently while using the mouse so it's not realistic for me to turn the mouse off every time I stop using it.Edit: Today is day 5 of using the mouse while I wait to receive the other mouse I bought. The mouse no longer consistently turns on when I turn it off and on again to stop it from lagging.,105,1.0,2021,08,August,22
Great for the price,4,"I really liked this mouse.  The design is sleek, I can use the little attachment for my Mac to make it compatible and it maneuvered well.

Frustrating because if your in the middle of something I have to go back to old mouse until this mouse is ready to use. I love the feel of it though and the cool lights.,52,5.0,2021,08,August,21

Broken,1,This is not working,4,1.0,2021,08,August,21
great range. finally we found a wireless mouse that works well.,11,"The mouse is sturdy and the rainbow lighting feature is fun. It auto shuts off after 10 minutes (I think) which is great for saving the battery. I thought that having to put it on a charger would be a major inconvenience it's not, at all. The recharge is quick and I only do it once a week, so far.",60,5.0,2021,08,August,21
Cool but not really responsive,5,This little mouse works great for my needs. It charges straight away from my laptop and functions as expected. I would buy it again and I recommend it to anyone needing an inexpensive wireless mouse.,35,3.0,2021,08,August,21
You get what you pay for.,6,Very cool lighting as seen in the photos and it's a soft touch mouse... no loud clicks here!,18,1.0,2021,08,August,20

It only worked one day,5,great little mouse.  Fits nicely in my hand. You can turn the LED on or off.  Click to wake from sleep.  Quiet clicking.  I like it :),27,1.0,2021,08,August,20
Nice Mouse,2,👍🎁💕,1,4.0,2021,08,August,20
Love this mouse,3,"Purchased this because of it can be recharged with any usb port, no batteries required. It is also compact with a low profile. It will be great for travel because it will take up very little space. Fits easily in a pocket without bulging out.",45,5.0,2021,08,August,20
Stopped charging,2,This was a disappointing and irritating order. I am a college student and a full time manager so I work a lot on my laptop. I ordered a mouse for ease of certain tasks that required a right click or highlights. This mouse was unusable directly out of the box. Charged it up and it never held a charge long enough to work. Very disappointing and a waste of time.,70,1.0,2021,08,August,20
Stopped working less than a month after buying,8,"The mouse works fine, but i was disappointed that the color did not match my MacBook as it shows.",19,2.0,2021,08,August,20
Sleek and Quiet,3,"I probably should have known... but the light is either red or it cycles through colors. This is probably cool for gamers or middle school kids. I would rather be able to pick a color, but that is not a feature available. Which - is probably something I should have expected - but I was being hopeful.",57,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Great affordable mouse,3,Really like the feel of the mouse in my hand. Have dropped it numerous times and it keeps working like a charm. So far I am really pleased with it,30,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Great performance & feel,4,"Nice mouse, but would not charge after single use. Tried with the usb on the computer, other usb chargers, even switched their cord out…",24,5.0,2021,08,August,11
Cheap but cool looking mouse. Does the job,8,"This mouse has become my new best friend! I have arthritis which has severely affected my hands. Its extremely ergonomic in shape and usage. The mouse is absolutely quiet as promised, plus is easily used without a huge amount of pressure from my fingers, hand, or wrist . The mouse also moves very easily on my mouse pad with no glitches or hesitations. My hands are grateful, and so am I!Another feature is the light additions which means it can be found anywhere in the dark. Also the aqua was an excellent choice in color for me as it does show against many darker colorsOnce charged the battery is good for a quite a few days. I do use the mouse from four to eight hours daily (and sometimes more). I have only had to charge the mouse once in the past week after using continuously for EIGHT days. Actually it was still working but had become a bit slow to react . Rather than wait for it to quit completely I charged it during the night so it was ready in the morning for the next week.I am very glad I chose to try this mouse. My next purchase of a mouse (if or when needed) will be a repeat of this one in a different color.This is an unpaid and unsolicited review from a grateful owner.",228,3.0,2021,08,August,20
It’s rechargeable.,2,"it’s a good size weight and shape but it bothers me that you can’t turn the red light off when you move it. if you have the rainbow light on, the red light still goes on when you move it so you don’t really get the rainbow effect",48,5.0,2021,08,August,20
Easy to connect,3,"Let's face it, it just a mouse, but kinda fun to have the colors, since my keyboard is colored too!",20,5.0,2021,08,August,19
DOESNT WORK,2,Loved everything about this mouse until the charging jack came loose after three months of use. There is no way to charge it now.  I guess you get what you pay for.,32,1.0,2021,08,August,19
Not worth the money!,4,This mouse is very comfortable and the colors are super cool. It’s also very economical and works well. Highly recommend!,20,1.0,2021,08,August,19
Do not buy way too small for average size hands,10,I love this mouse! The colors are beautiful and I've gotten many compliments on it. It feels great to use as well. I took away one star because the charging cord stopping working about a day after using it. Easily charges with any micro USB though. It's been a couple months and still works being used every day at work.,60,1.0,2021,08,August,19

Great While It Lasted,4,"Good if you want a wireless mouse that works for 3 months.  Otherwise, buy something else.",16,2.0,2021,08,August,19
Good Luck Getting the Dongle Out,6,"This wireless mouse is very light and thin. It can be used for a long time after charging. I didn't read the instruction at all, I just plugged the receiver which is hided at the bottom of itself into the USB port of the markbook air and it began to work normally. It’s quite easy and quick to get start.",60,4.0,2021,08,August,19
Needs to be charged all the time,7,I love this wireless mouse! It has nice LED lights on it and it lasts for up to 5-7 days without a charge!I definitely recommend this product!,27,1.0,2021,08,August,19

As advertised. Love you can’t really hear clicks.,8,Its a great mouse but it stops tracking if I stop using it.. like the ponter starts lagging.,18,5.0,2021,08,August,19
Functional mouse that does not need battery,7,"The one I ordered will only turn on if the switch is in a strange position that is between the clicks. I had to move the switch carefully with two fingers until I found the very small area where it turns on. Sending it back because its almost impossible to use, if the switch gets moved it takes a few minutes to turn it back on.",66,5.0,2021,08,August,19
Would not charge after single use.,6,"I used this guy for dayssssss upon receiving without charging. A few times I’ve had (thought I had) issues with the mouse but I had it backwards. That’s my main complaint- too easy to put backwards. It doesn’t attract dust and dirt, works on every surface I’ve put it on…..and it’s cute",52,1.0,2021,08,August,19
Don't buy,2,"Got this for a great price, the size is perfect for my hands and is easy setup.",17,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Never worked,2,The mouse arrived with great packaging and easy to do follow instructions. The feel is very smooth. I like the on off switch which is very sturdy and I think will last for a long time. Charging is simple. Able to store USB adapter on mouse. Best of all the lights are bright and as expected,56,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Junk,1,"Loved the mouse and was using it regularly for 4 months. Just recently, the scrolling wheel completely stopped working. All of the other functions work, but the scrolling feature is a must for me.",34,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Worthless,1,This mouse is on point. Literally. I had never thought of buying one to this slant and Size until the color locked me in. It's an absolute match to my laptop. The setup was quick and easy. I simply turned it on input the USB and was using within seconds. It's very versatile and works with or without a pad. Lightweight and easy to store with the flat shape.,69,1.0,2021,08,August,18
So Disappointed,2,This is a second time I've bought this mouse and its broken on me within a few months. It just decides to work only when it wants to.,28,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Love it!,2,"It worked for a month and a half, now it's glitchy and won't work. Pass this up and buy a quality mouse. Looks pretty with the colors.... Other than that... It was a waste of money.",36,5.0,2021,08,August,18
Cute but broke very easily,5,Doesn’t hold charge for even a full day.,8,3.0,2021,08,August,18
"Easy pairing, and reliable!",4,"I use it in my class. As I move around classroom, I click the mouse to move on with my presentation. Good so far.",24,5.0,2021,08,August,18
Not the most durable,4,Only used it 4 times and went to turn it on and won’t power up. Lasted 32 days. 2 days past the return time they gave of 30 days. What a waste of money. Thanks god it wasn’t much. Don’t waste a dollar on it.,45,3.0,2021,08,August,18
doesn’t scroll,2,"I love this mouse! I use it on multiple devices and it uploads fast. I like it how sleep mode would kick in if you haven't used it in a while. However, it is easy to wake up as well. I like it how you can switch between solid red to rainbow colors. Its quite and moves smoothly. Did I mention I love it?",64,1.0,2021,08,August,18
Nice mouse,2,Light never turned on. Came dirty,6,5.0,2021,08,August,17
charge last a long time works great,7,"Bought this LED wireless mouse July 5, 2021 and received it a couple of day later and really loved it!  Well now it's Aug. 24 and as of yesterday it suddenly stopped working correctly.  I don't even use it with the fancy light changes on.  I tried charging it a couple of times and even once over night and it is still not functioning as it should.I noticed that if left still for a few minutes it would sometimes function well, but only for a few seconds and then it would begin to sporadically move the cursor, if at all.  The little laser guide light goes dim and blinks quite fast.  I am thinking that it suddenly cannot hold a charge....?  Oh, I have also tried using it while connected to the charge port, but it does the same.I would have given it a 5 star rating if it continued working properly as I really like it.  However, since the sudden misfunction, I cannot give it more than 2 stars and I must say that I would NOT recommend this mouse anymore.",182,5.0,2021,08,August,17
comfort,1,"I love this mouse! it is very lightweight with an attractive look. One of my favorite features is that it is rechargeable. Second, you have the option of selecting one color (default to red) or multiple colors (swap automatically).  The switch is on the bottom portion of the mouse. My favorite feature is the fact that the mouse goes into sleep mode when you turn off your computer. Saved me so many times from having a dead mouse. It can also be charged while in use. Overall I would definitely recommend this mouse to friends and family.",97,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Sleek item but no LED lights,6,"Shipping was fast and I loved the LEDs. But today - after a week - it stopped working. I figured it needed a charge. It;s now been connected to my laptop for over three hours and the blue light has gone off, which is supposed to mean is all charged and ready to go. But when I disconnect it - nothing, Dead. Guess the low price was a giveaway I should have paid more attention to.",76,2.0,2021,08,August,17
Perfect!!,1,won't buy againdoesn't lite up as promised,7,5.0,2021,08,August,17
This works great!,3,Great product for the value,5,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Does not charge,3,"Within 3 minutes of plugging the new ""rechargeable"" mouse into a USB hub charger (thankfully it wasn't plugged into my daughter's brand new laptop she just opened for her birthday) my house started to smell like smoke and I found the charging cable melting to the mouse in the drawer I'd just put them in to pre-charge. If this had happened at night my house would have probably caught fire. DO NOT BUY. FIRE HAZARD 🔥 DANGEROUS",77,1.0,2021,08,August,17
Nice,1,"The wired mouse I've been using at work was driving me insane with its loud clicking noises. I love the convenience of this one being wireless, so it's easy to use with my desktop or laptop. It's super easy to install, and while the buttons aren't completely silent, they are significantly more quiet than your average mouse. The colorful LEDs are fun, but it's not a feature I'll be using a lot. So far I've had no issues with connectivity or responsiveness at all. I certainly recommend this mouse at this price point.",93,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Smooth operation!,2,The mouse would be fine except it stopped tracking within 1 month.  Cheaper isn't better,15,5.0,2021,08,August,17
Mouse does not stay charged more than one day,9,You can hardly maneuver the clicker with this mouse. It doesn’t do its main function. The LED is ok … I guess. But what’s the point of a mouse that doesn’t do it’s job!? I guess I have a new flashlight. I’d give 0 stars if I could. Don’t waste your time or money on this!,56,1.0,2021,08,August,17
Doesn’t work,2,Don't buy this product.  This lasted me about a month and 1 week..just enough time to pass where the window of returning was no longer available. Mouse quit on me while I was taking a final for a test. Perfect timing.,41,1.0,2021,08,August,17
just don’t order,3,I bought this mouse thinking a rechargeable was the way to do. It worked well for about a day.  I tried to recharge it several times but would not hold any charge at all. I've gone back to a battery operated mouse.,42,1.0,2021,08,August,17
Useless as a wireless mouse,5,Feels great nice color looks like it will last a very long time. Charge last along time as well.,19,1.0,2021,08,August,17
Garbage,1,"The left mouse button is impossible to use. I cannot click and drag. It does not respond to a double click. What a nightmare. I would not recommend this at all. I was very excited for a wireless, no battery mouse. I will be returning this.",46,1.0,2021,08,August,17
This is one of the most frustrating pieces of equipment I've ever used.,13,This product was definitely worth the money. It's equipped with every function desirable for a wireless mouse. Being rechargeable is alot better compared to constantly switching batteries personally. The RGB lights were nice as well.,35,2.0,2021,08,August,17
Super cute and works great,5,It was working great at first but now it's not working. I've had this mouse for about 1 month.,19,5.0,2021,08,August,16

Terrible,1,Color is not shiny black. Cheap plastic material,8,1.0,2021,08,August,16
It's an okay mouse for the price.,7,Works great,2,3.0,2021,08,August,16
You get what you pay for,6,This mouse is great!  I love that it is so compact.  Being rechargeable is a plus for me!!  The lights make it fun to use!!,25,1.0,2021,08,August,16
Awesome battery life!,3,"First time charging this mouse I started smelling a burnt plastic smell in my home. Walked over to where it was charging and noticed the smell was a lot stronger, I reached down to unplug it and the cord was red hot!!! Had I not been in that room it would have started a fire. Not happy!!!",57,5.0,2021,08,August,16
NO BATTERIES!!,2,This wireless mouse works great and is easy to set up. The led lights gives it a nice look and the click is silent. The battery last a day I haven’t had to change them. Over all a 10/10 mouse,40,5.0,2021,08,August,16
Charging port failed after 3 weeks,6,"I have tried charging this mouse with the original cables it came with, did not charge. I then tried multiple cables and power sources I already owned, still did not charge. I left it plugged in for 12 hours while I was away from home, I come home to an uncharged mouse. The blue light stays on for about 30 seconds before shutting off. The design and price were what attracted me to choosing this specific mouse, I would recommend spending a bit more on a quality mouse that can serve its purpose.",93,1.0,2021,08,August,16
Mouse works fine BUT,4,"Worked for 1 day, then.... nothing won't even turn on.",10,1.0,2021,08,August,16

Receieved Friday used for 2 hours then put away. Non responsive monday.,12,"The mouse works, but after less than 1 week of use by my son, the roller ball no longer works. You can't scroll with it. The rest of it works, for now, but will probably not make it through the school year.",42,1.0,2021,08,August,16
NOPE,1,"This is a low rise mouse. Very responsive and smooth movement. I would definitely buy one again.Note: I don't play games, so I can't speak to that aspect.",28,1.0,2021,08,August,16
Love it,2,It broke the same day,5,5.0,2021,08,August,16
Didn’t have charging cable or USB attachment.,7,I have been using this mouse for a couple of weeks now.  I love the rechargeable feature and the battery seems to last a long time (never turn it off).  Highly recommend this one!!!,34,1.0,2021,08,August,15
Only holds a 15 minute charge,6,Item broke already. The wheel in the middle does not work. Did not last 2 months,16,1.0,2021,08,August,15
Too flat,2,"great range. finally we found a wireless mouse that works well. we use this for television viewing. we have our laptop attached to our television. we are a good 4-6 feet away from our television and laptop when we use this mouse. again, it has great range. easy to use and works quickly. highly recommended.",55,3.0,2021,08,August,15
Rechargeable,1,"I just got the item and to be honest I didn’t expect much from it in the first place but reading reviews I thought it was relatively good. The clicking tends to stick w mine and I tried doing a CPS (Clicks per second test) and out of the 20 time I clicked, the test only registered 9. I can say it wasn’t the tests fault since I have to triple click most things in order to pretty much do anything. For everyday work I won’t say I recommend it but it’s enough for that but for gaming I do not recommend this since 90% of your clicks won’t work because the mouse itself isn’t that great quality.",118,5.0,2021,08,August,15
Could be better,3,It worked great while it worked but after less then three months my mouse has stopped working. It turns on and lights up but will no connect to the usb wirelessly any more. I won’t buy again and wouldn’t recommend if you’re looking for something to last.,47,3.0,2021,08,August,15
Excellent product,2,"If you're looking for a wireless mouse, keep looking! This is not it! The first one I received didn't charge. So, they sent me another one which I started using at the beginning of July, and now it doesn't work anymore. Didn't even last 2 months with normal usage, no gaming or anything. Such a shame, because I actually liked it.",61,5.0,2021,08,August,15

Needs improvement,2,Purchased on june 28.  I never charge over night.  I  only charge mouse when needed  and turn off after each use however month and a half later mouse is no longer charging.  Very short life span.,36,2.0,2021,08,August,14
Great Wireless/Rechargeable Everyday Mouse/Cool Lights,5,Pretty lights but when it sleeps you have to turn it off and wait ten seconds and turn it back on.  Stopped working completely less than a month after buying so now its a light up paper weight,38,5.0,2021,08,August,14
Smooth and quite!,3,Does it’s job. Looks pretty and is rechargeable,8,5.0,2021,08,August,14

Broke after one use and wouldn't re-charge after the first use either,12,"Full charge lasts two hours or less. If you want to use it all day, you have to charge it three to five times and of course can't use it while it's charging. I'm buying a different wireless mouse today.",40,1.0,2021,08,August,12
Broken out of the box,5,"As advertised. Love that you can’t really hear the clicks. Charge it once a week and use it approx. 40 to 45 hrs a week, on color changing setting. Easy set up. Would buy again. Only thing I don’t like is the short charging cable which is a personal preference. You would need a usb plug right next to the mouse if you still need to use it while it’s charging.",71,1.0,2021,08,August,12
Broke within a week,4,"This was for my son for school work and he loved the features and the fact that it has lights to make it fancy. It seems pretty smooth without making clicking noise and compact, pretty good alternative for expensive mouses from branded ones",43,1.0,2021,08,August,12

I love the led feature, and I used it to play games with friends (Val, league, genshin, etc) and it is passable for someone who plays casually like me but probably not for someone picky about equipment.However, today it spent some time in the side pocket of my backpack and no longer seems to work :( I turn it on and the light flashes and goes off again, and there is no way to take it apart or try to fix it. If you transport your laptop/pc a lot I would hesitate to get this mouse, but otherwise I was a fan.",109,1.0,2021,08,August,10

Stopped working after a few weeks,6,"I was initially in love with this mouse however soon after while scrolling, the mouse stopped scrolling. You don’t realize how something so small you really see crucial everything works. For the scroll to just stop, I literally want to throw the whole mouse out and probably will.

BUT and this is a strong but, if you so much as bump the usb plug in ever so lightly, all use the the mouse ceases and you have to re set it up. I usually use my computer on the couch with my kids next to me and sometimes they bump it, or my dog, or even me. It could be super light, and it still will make me unplug it and re do it over. It's really annoying.",99,3.0,2021,08,August,05

Gets the job done,4,"I was searching for a wireless mouse on Amazon and for the price, this was a no-brainer. I received this mouse in the mail in small compact packaging, very simple and easy to get it going. The charging cable that it comes with charged the mouse in about 2 hours, once I plugged it in the mouse lit up blue and turned off once it was fully charged. I purchased the Gray to match my laptop, looks good and not as shiny as I thought it would be which is great. Very comfortable with it in my hand and I have pretty big hands, really receptive to the movement when scrolling. The lights feature is cool if you want to have something different. The silent mouse clicking is a great feature as well if you ever have to do work in a quiet space you will not hear the loud clicking noise coming from this mouse.

like it,2,"This mouse is terrible. I bought it for work, its not like I needed anything super advanced, just something that would give me a little more space than the touchpad.

Easy to switch between laptops with this mouse, so she can watch YouTube and play games on her personal laptop, and scroll and jump between apps easily on the school laptop. Of course its not as solid as the Apple version, so thats why not 5 stars",72,5.0,2021,08,August,02

I'm so disappointed in the quality of this mouse.",87,5.0,2021,08,August,02
Very cute and easy to use. No problems so far!,10,"this product is crap, do not buy, opened fresh out of the box and immediately had trouble. lightweight and cheap feeling, does not slide particularly well, although sleek, it isn't the most ergonomic thing. but worst of all, after plugging in and turning on, the mouse will work normally for around 30 secs, if you leave it idle for longer than that, the response becomes choppy and the mouse essentially stops working. tried on multiple devices to no avail. DO NOT BUY, in most cases id say you get what you pay for, but here it feels like even less than that.",102,5.0,2021,08,August,02

I have tried charging it (it's currently plugged into my computer, as the instructions specify, but it's dead to the world).  I have tried all of troubleshooting suggestions but you can't troubleshoot something that won't turn on for love or money.  So, for one week I was happy.  Now I'm just irritated and disappointed.

This company has the best customer service in the WORLD!!!!!,10,Did not work at all,5,5.0,2021,07,July,26
UPDATED REVIEW,2,The mouse is comfortable to use with its very slim low profile. Its accuracy is normal or average to the regular computer user.  Mine did not come with the type C receiver. I assume it was sold once before and not checked to see if all parts were there before reselling. The most annoying thing about the mouse is having to charge over and over again. You have to remember to plug it in everyday for the user who is on the his or her computer a lot. There is no meter to check for how much battery is left and can be annoying when it starts being erratic because it needs juicing up. It seems to go into sleep mode really quickly so you will have to click a button to start moving again...a slight annoyance.  Not a bad mouse for the price but the annoying things about it have me going back to replaceable battery ones that I am used to using.  The colors are nice and pretty but you get over that really quick.,177,4.0,2021,07,July,25

Great rechargeable mouse,3,"Ok, my trackball that I've had for 10 years is dying, so I went back to the mouse.  You can spend over $100 on a mouse, but unless you are a hardcore gamer, and even then, probably not worth it to be honest, so I went with this affordable mouse.  Totally works. it is VERY thin, I think I would have liked a little more meat on it, maybe even for it to be a big heavier, but it's $12 so it's worth it.  I recommend.",86,5.0,2021,07,July,23

Excellent,1,"I was super excited for this mouse. Its so sleek and small, it was perfect for me. Unfortunately it doesn't work all that well. Its super glitchy, especially when you turn it on color mode. It lags and sometimes it doesn't even click on what you're trying to click on. Its much easier to just use my mouse pad on my computer.",62,5.0,2021,07,July,21
Bad Mouse,2,"I loved the design and cool light features, but true to the old saying... you get what you pay for.  This mouse was pretty bad.  It jumps and skips all over the page and you have to click the left mouse button 2 or 3 times before it responds to your request.  Very frustrating to say the least.  Not a good buy...",62,1.0,2021,07,July,21

Wouldn’t HolA Charge,3,"I had to replace my mouse and decided to try this mouse out since it had a lot of reviews. It works great!The mouse looks good and has a sleek design. The LED lights are a fun touch and the DPI feature is nice to have. I had zero issues connecting the mouse to my MacBook wirelessly to with the USB-C port.What I did notice was my hand started to feel uncomfortable with only an hour of use. Coming from a mouse that had an arch in the design, this mouse was a little flatter than that.Another are the clicks and scrolls. It definitely is not quiet when it comes to clicking and scrolling. It's not loud like compared to regular mice, but it is louder than my previous quiet mouse.I did end up returning the mouse, but I would still recommend this to those who like this mouse design. It's still a great mouse overall.",156,1.0,2021,07,July,21

The best,2,"At first i just loved the mouse and it was so pretty when I turn on the lights. But when it was time to recharge, and it just never recharged, and I tried and tried for well over a day.

Slim and Easy to Manuver,5,"Don't waste your time with this mouse. I got this mouse for my work because the wireless mouse that I had was loaned to me. Straight from the box, it didn't even work. It will light up red whenever I turn it on, it won't connect to my MAC at all even with the c port installed. It wouldn't work. AT ALL. I switched it off and on.

Waste of money,3,Colors are fun. But it doesn’t react great. Charge doesn’t last long if you forget to turn it off over night.  When it’s low on battery it doesn’t work well. Overall it’s an inconvenience.. amending my review to include the following.  If you post a bad review the company hassles you by email to take it down. First by offering a refund. When you tell them not interested they then offered 30 bucks. You can’t pay me to take a review down.  That’s the point of a review. Just make a better product.  You should just refund me.,98,1.0,2021,07,July,17
"Easy to use, colorful.",4,Battery won’t charge. I guess you get what you pay for. Save the 15$ or whatever this cost is and invest in something better.Wow. Don’t trust these other reviews guys. If you write a bad review aka the truth they will ask you to delete it. If the product doesn’t work obviously people are going to say something. Save your money people and buy from someone else that is better quality.,71,5.0,2021,07,July,17
Worth it,2,"UPDATE: SELLER HAS SENT MULTIPLE EMAILS ASKING ME TO REMOVE THIS REVIEW IN EXCHANGE FOR MONEY, CLAIMING ""This is an email from Amazon costumer service.""This is the 2nd purchase for me.  The first one wasn't labeled ""Upgrade.""  It lasted about 6 months until I dropped it on the floor.  This one, the ""Upgrade,"" doesn't work well at all.  The left and right click are very touchy and the scrolling drags and skips across pages.  The connectivity was also delayed.  Despite trying different computers and different settings, the problems persisted.  Returned the ""Upgrade.""",92,5.0,2021,07,July,17

Love it,2,"I mean, this is a wireless mouse that has pretty lights and stuff, but I swear it doesn't catch well and I have to slide it like a pro curler. Either it dies really fast or it just decides to stop properly working, not sure what the true issue is. I like the texture and how sleek it is, but when it doesn't properly work, it drives me absolutely nuts. I even got a mouse pad and it still gives me issues...",82,5.0,2021,07,July,16

Thank you for being an honest company that stands behind the products you sell I'm a customer for life !!!!! Don't hesitate to buy this item you wont regret it.,135,2.0,2021,07,July,14
Very Pretty,2,"IUPDATED:  (11-13-21). Returned and bought another as I really liked the way it fit my hand, etc.  The first one didn’t get charged til it was out and then wouldn’t recharge after it died.  I’ve plugged this one to charge more frequently and am happy to keep it.  Not going to let it die cuz don’t want to suffer finding out it’s a design flaw.  On the other hand, could have just been the one I first bought. I am so disappointed.  I received my pretty mouse, charged it and love it!  Fits my small hands, no clicking sounds, easy to use.  I received it around July 10.  Today is July 25 and the cursor won't work!!  I hadn't charged it so I plugged it in to charge.  The wheel still works but the clicker won't work.  When I press it, nothing happens.  I would exchange it for a new one but then I don't have many days left to see if it works and really don't want to take a chance on losing my money.  These mice seem to work great for some and don't work for some.  I may figure out which credit card gives a year warranty beyond the normal one which is non existent.  At least I could try again.",214,5.0,2021,07,July,14

Good value,2,It is too small for average size hand. The mouse literally disappear in your hand. I used it for 10 minutes and it was very uncomfortable. My fingers do not rest on the buttons.

Super awesome!,2,"I was super excited when I received this mouse with it’s comfort and of course, the pretty LED lights were cool. It came fully charged & worked great UNTIL after I charged it for the 1st time. Strange—it no longer worked!

Against better judgement I agreed to receive a free replacement giving it another chance— so I’ll follow up with a 2nd review!FOLLOW UP: 2nd one worked for 2 weeks and then STOPPED WORKING altogether. The company actually contacted me after submitting my initial review, offering full reimbursement if I’d take it down, followed by instructions on how to do so.

However- the blue paint is already peeling on the bottom and I've only used it a little while. Not sure if it came like that or is already wearing. There are probably other products for a similar price that could be better quality.,79,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Not compatible to my Samsung laptop,6,"Cutest, stylish, clean looked mouse. I have white monitor and white keyboard it goes very well with those. Also it has lights and it’s super comfortable ergonomic. I’m happy with this purchase",32,3.0,2021,07,July,06
perfect,1,"The first day I received the product it worked very well, though I couldn't get seem to get it to charge. It had enough juice to get through the first day so I wasn't too concerned. By the second day, though, something had happened to the optical portion because moving the mouse often wouldn't move the cursor (and never moved it as fast as it should). The buttons all seem to work fine still, but without the ability to actually move the mouse as I want to it's pretty useless.",90,5.0,2021,07,July,06
NOT  BLUETOOTH,2,"Works great! Color just like into the picture. The best thing is that it’s charge last for a very long time, I don’t have to charge it everyday!",28,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Waste of money,3,The mouse didn't work after the first few hours of use. Troubleshooting didn't work.,14,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Not the quality I would have hoped,7,It's basically junk doesn't hold a charge it works fine as long as its plugged into the charger but that defies the purpose of a wireless mouse,27,3.0,2021,07,July,06
Good for the price,4,Works very well but wish it had option for regular battery.,11,5.0,2021,07,July,06
Don’t waste your money!,4,Quit working after 2 weeks of use,7,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Rally easy to install and use,6,I love this mouse. If you have smaller hands or like a mouse that doesn’t feel to big in your hands then this is for you. The color and lights are a cool touch as well.,36,5.0,2021,07,July,06
not a very reliable...,4,Like the mouse but having to recharge it with USB all the time is annoying and unproductive.,17,1.0,2021,07,July,05

Perfect size mouse,3,Like this mouse work good,5,5.0,2021,07,July,04
Great product!,2,"It's exactly as bad as I should have expected for the price. I've had it for 3 days and it will randomly stop working. I have to turn it off and on again to get the mouse to begin working again. The plastic it's made out of is cheaper than it looks in the picture. Honestly, I should have spent a few more bucks and bought something better.",68,5.0,2021,07,July,04
Ya get what you pay for...but there are cheaper options that are better,13,I like my new mouse. I needed an inexpensive yet durable mouse and this one has been great so far. I have only used it for a day but so far so good. Great purchase.,35,3.0,2021,07,July,04
Where's the cursor now??,4,"It's a cool mouse, but I don't think it's worth the price. Whenever I use it, my curser ocassionally jerks around the screen and makes it difficult to use. It's not my computer's fault because I switched mouses and the other one works fine. Also, the color changing lights are see-through from the top (I got a white one) and it kind of ruins the feel. It just feels really cheap. Honestly though, if it was maybe $5 cheaper and it didn't glitch the curser I'd say it's worth it. I like how you can charge it rather than switching out batteries, and I like how it comes with a lightning USB adapter.",113,2.0,2021,07,July,04
Why battery.....WHY,2,"Love this little guy! The colors are fun, they change everytime the mouse moves! Helps you to remember to turn it off! Easy to charge with USB, glides smooth! Totally love it!",32,2.0,2021,07,July,03
😀,1,"Worked great for a month. Mouse connects via a USB receiver. I've only disconnected the receiver a few times when not using the mouse. However, after disconnecting a few times, I can't reconnect the receiver without it being ""loose"": the instant my mouse connects, it will disconnect because the USB is too loose now. After a MONTH.Edit: Customer service reps have reached out to me, offering me money to delete my review.",72,3.0,2021,07,July,03
Quality,1,"I like the change in color but this is definitely not a gaming mouse. I needed an alternative to keep me in the works so I chose something that was cheap and nice looking. Its silent and has a nice speed to it, not too much sensitivity.",47,5.0,2021,07,July,03
It's ok,2,"This Mouse was Amazing when i first got it and it worked amazing for the first few months. Then i started having connecting issues, so i direct hooked it up to my PC and it worked like that for a Day. Now it Doesnt work at all. Dont Waste your money on this.",53,3.0,2021,07,July,03
Sleek design,2,I needed a wireless mouse and specifically wanted one that matched my new laptop. This mouse exceeded my expectations. I love the that it lights up and comes in a variety of colors. It's kinda hard to find a silver mouse especially one that is compatible with a Type  C usb so I am happy.,55,5.0,2021,07,July,03

excellent mouse,2,"*Update* Since writing this review they have emailed me twice offering a $10 refund if I took the review down. When I didn’t reply they offered me a $30 refund (?) again in return I would have to remove the review. They stated they were a small company and my review was hurting them… but with over 15,000 reviews, I don’t see how that’s possible…The light goes off like it is charged, however, it won’t turn on more than about 10 seconds. I’ve tried 2 different charging cords and same thing happens. Don’t waste your money.",96,5.0,2021,06,June,29
Nice works great.,3,"This was gifted to me as I was in need of a better mouse for working at home. Very comfortable to hold, able to right-click and easy set up. No issues, highly recommend this mouse.",35,5.0,2021,06,June,29

Works great.,2,It is ergonomic and love the color.  It works well and is pretty quiet when clicking and scrolling.,18,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Not for someone who works for more than an hour at a time on the computer.,16,"Basically bought this for work.  Very light, which is good to use for.  Don’t have to fight with the wired mouse anymore.  Like the light that comes with it, goes with a good gaming system.Overall very well built.",38,1.0,2021,06,June,28
review,1,"I wish the charger was longer it’s so short. I used it once and the mouse was not calibrated. I had to bang it a couple of times then it worked. Buying a new one, I do not recommend this product.",41,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Excellent Mouse,2,The photo is misleading. Only one color shows at a time.  Mouse is not as accurate as most.,18,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Perfect Compact Laptop Mouse!,4,"This mouse looked promising based on all the positive reviews. It is light, good to hold, and has good battery life. It is also quiet (with exceptions–see below)Its main problem however is that the middle button (the scrollwheel) becomes unusable after only a short amount of use. After which, the button needs to be pressed repeatedly in order to register a button press.Also, compared to the LMB & RMB buttons (which are sometimes too light and register button presses accidentally), the MMB is extremely rigid in comparison. It is also very noisy, which is ironic as the other two buttons are completely silent. It is much more noisy than other mice I have used (which is about 20).As someone who relies on this button during daily usage, this is very frustrating, and frankly a serious design flaw. I'd like to emphasize that the mouse has been treated well (i.e, not rough). I also bought the non-LED version of this mouse, and the *exact same problem* appeared after the same amount of time.Another drawback is that the mouse does not indicate when the battery is low, leaving one to guess when to recharge it.It often becomes erratic (mouse pointer moves around) and does not register movement well, requiring a power cycle. This is occuring on more than one system.All in all a decent attempt, but quite a few issues need to be ironed out. I doubt the many positive reviews for this product have been based on any more than a couple of weeks usage, as these issues are consistent and appeared after 2-3 months.Frankly, I expect a mouse to last _significantly longer_, and also have a useable middle mouse button. I hope these issues get addressed by the manufacturer.",289,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Great!,1,"UPDATE: I have been sent 4 emails from the seller begging me to change my review, 2 of the emails offered me $40 to do so. This explains the positive reviews despite the terrible product.the mouse freezes constantly. left and right click will work but the mouse will not move. this is the worst mouse i've ever had. it also goes into sleep mode after 10 minutes of not being used, which is annoying and no way to turn it off. the light also stays on while in sleep mode which doesn't make sense. the charge doesn't last very long at all, charging it every couple of days.",108,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Love this mouse!,3, I just live my cordless keyboard and mouse. They match my HP desktop computer perfectly.,15,5.0,2021,06,June,28
Didn’t last,2,"The Good- looks nice and feels good in your hand. The Bad- the right click button is too sensitive, I'm constantly opening up the right click menu. The pointer freezes and I have to turn the mouse off and on to unfreeze it. The Ugly- I ordered a silver mouse and I got dark gray.",55,1.0,2021,06,June,28
Not impressed,2,"So for anyone wondering, charging it is easy. If you plug it and the light in the middle is blue, that means that it is not fully charged. The blue light will turn off after being fully charged. Mine arrived on Monday and on Wednesday it turned off. I plugged it in and took around 2.5 hours to charge it (the light turned off). The clicks are silent and is very comfortable to use. One thing I do not like is the ""scroller,"" which can be a little too hard (I tend to open many tabs at once, at work and while I am on Pinterest lol) but that's just me. Overall, is a nice mouse and I hope it can stay with me forever (this is my 4th mouse in less than a year).",135,1.0,2021,06,June,28
LOVE IT,2,"This mouse is a perfect addition to your laptop. It is easy to set up, very affordable, and the ergonomic design reduces hand fatigue.",24,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Very easy to connect and stylish,6,I needed an ultraslim mouse for my laptop and this one works great. My only complaint (if you can call it that) is its length. It would fit better in my carry case if it were shorter.,37,5.0,2021,06,June,27

right mouse button doesn't always work.,6,I got this product 2 days ago and everything was working great until I wanted to use my mouse for a different computer only to find out that the casing for drive was stuck in my computer and has no rendered both that usb port and my mouse useless.  The mouse is great in use but now I cant use the mouse or the port until I can find strong enough tweezers to get the piece out.,77,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Good and sleek mouse.,4,"I bought a mouse for my daughter after she took my mouse while on vacation.  She loves it!  It has a location to place the usb connector while not plugged in.  It has a low profile which looks good with any computer.  A plus, it has a usb-c to usb 3.0 connect along with a usb 2.0 charging cable.  It also has a solid color mode and a changes colors mode.  Good price for a wireless mouse.",77,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Nice to the touch,4,"Overall, liked the feel and responsiveness but the durability was the big issue.  This mouse was for a work computer with light everyday use, and within less than two months it would no longer charge or work properly.  I  took it apart to verify the battery was making connection, and even replaced the battery.  However, the mouse still would not track properly.  Perhaps, I just got a dud, but decided to spend a few more dollars and purchase a different brand.",81,5.0,2021,06,June,27

Great Mouse!,2,"Came charged. Has an off, on, and then the color switch. Quiet quick. My favorite mode is that when it’s idle for a while it shuts down and you just click and it comes back to life. Exactly what I wanted. Easy USB charge. Hope it lasts me for a while!!",51,5.0,2021,06,June,26
Not so good,3,"I bought two of these to use with our laptops. Both computers recognized them right away and we were able to use them easily. I like the variety of colors offered and the lower profile, so my hand doesn't cramp like it has with some other styles. The light up colors are fun. I think it was a good value for the money.",63,1.0,2021,06,June,25

First impression,2,"The major flaw with the mouse for me is that the battery life is almost nonexistent. It lasts only about 2 hours for me.

Wireless and Rechargeable Mouse that lights up!,7," Feels good in my hand and works well. The roller wheel works as a third button which is important for my work. Colors are pretty and you can turn the lights off so that's a bonus. It charges so no batteries and I'm loving that. The only issue I'm finding is that it goes to sleep very fast. If you wait to long to move it, you have to click the power like next to the roller wheel. Not a big deal just annoying sometimes. Overall I'm happy with it.",90,5.0,2021,06,June,20
Love it,2,It came really fast. I got it in one day! It is really sleek and works really smooth. I chose my favorite color of course but I love all the colors the light goes through! I also really like that it has a button to keep the mouse on but turn off the light! And of course it is nice that you can charge it rather than use batteries.

Cool Mouse but doesn't work smoothly,6,I like the way it handles while moving it.  I think it is a little small for a big hand.  It is cute and colorful.  I have not played any games with it yet but I am sure it will be quick and smooth.,44,2.0,2021,06,June,10
Great for price,3,"I have had this mouse for all of 15 minutes and I am planning on returning it.Honestly it looks nice and I like that it's rechargable.However, it's easily one of the worst I've ever used (I've used probably 50 different models in my career alone). First, clicking the mouse requires much stronger force than any other mouse I've used and on top of that it's very inconsistent. Looking through the gaps where the LEDs show out of I can see the mechanical device which actuates the click is a tiny plastic arm. No chance that will lasts for an expected period of time.It seemed to have been packaged fine, so I don't believe it was damaged or DOA.Don't buy this.",120,5.0,2021,06,June,18

Doesn't stay charged very long,5,"It’s cute & pink & is just like the picture! It’s a really nice mouse, but I’m sad that it doesn’t work with my iPad. I put photos of the manual, and it says that mouse needs a USB-port to operate. I think that black USB goes into computer and communicates with the one beneath the mouse.",57,3.0,2021,06,June,17
Works great charges fast,4,"Mouse only worked half the time, then never held a charge.",11,5.0,2021,06,June,17
The best mouse on amazon,5,**Update**After using the mouse for around 4 days it just completely stopped working. The lights come on and it appears to charge but the buttons no longer work and the optical lens doesn't pick up any movement. Don't even bother with this. It's trash.Not a very reliable mouse.  After just a couple days of use it stops working intermittently which is frustrating. I wouldn't purchase again. That said it is a very quiet mouse with no audible click and it's a good size.,83,5.0,2021,06,June,17

Lightweight Easy to set up,5, I wanted to find a very nice and stylish mouse and ran across this one. It was so very easy to connect to my laptop and very lightweight. I love the colorful light display. I've been using the wireless mouse for a few days and it appears to hold a good charge. You can't go wrong with this charger and the price was very reasonable compared to other brands with the same capabilities.,73,5.0,2021,06,June,14

Glitch-y piece of junk,4,Great mouse like the colors and sleekness. Also rechargeable!,9,1.0,2021,06,June,09
Good value for price,4,Feels very cheap and performs cheap too. both sides stick together when wanting to use just the left side button but they both go down and pop wen going back up. difficult to click on just a single item!,39,4.0,2021,06,June,09
Good while it lasted,4,"Worked fine at first, about a month in and now it gets glitchy for no reason. Flat design makes for poor support of hand. Not for gaming.",27,3.0,2021,06,June,09
Great design,2,Used this mouse twice. Went to use it a third time and it was completely dead. The led’s were still working but the mouse light underneath flickers then shuts off after being turned on. Waste of money.,37,4.0,2021,06,June,09

Top of the line.,4,"I read the reviews and ordered two.  One for home, one for office.  They both worked great for about 2.5 weeks.  I started having trouble with the charge not lasting.  And then by the time my return window expired, they were both worthless.  I can still plug in and the lights are pretty, perhaps a very weak night light?  That is what the star is for, the pretty lights.",69,5.0,2021,06,June,08
Replacement mouse has also quit working,6,"When I received this item it was thin, which is okay but it was also chipped off on the left side. Then, I simple drop and the mouse damn near shattered! And to stop it off, sometimes the cursor goes everywhere, which can be annoying when you’re working on particular items. I love it for the lights and how compact it is. Handle this item with care!",67,1.0,2021,06,June,08

Perfect for work use,4,Constantly had to charge. Cool light effects came at a cost. I ended up going to target and buying a $5 one that works much better and is battery operated.,30,5.0,2021,06,June,08
Great Value,2,"I like the overall design.  The slim profile and touch is good and the clicks are responsive.Where I'm struggling with this mouse is that as I'm trying to work, there is lag and the mouse will then jump around on the screen.  Also, trying to hold and highlight a group of text, for some reason it loses connection.  what I've ended up having to do is clicking on my document and then using my Shift+Arrow Keys to highlight the text that I need.For general web browsing, this mouse isn't bad.  For productivity, it's not really working for me and i'm going to go back to my wired mouse.",108,5.0,2021,06,June,08

"Great price, great performance and cute too!",7,"Mouse works, LGB died almost immediately. The only color actively working on this mouse is the red led and the blue when charging.

Fun little mouse,3,"At first I loved this mouse, it worked great and the battery lasted a long time. But I have bought 2 of these now, and the first one was faulty and this second one has only worked for about 2 months  and now will not connect! This product would be fantastic if it  worked longer that 2 months. But for the price, it's not terrible.",65,5.0,2021,06,June,08
Beautifully lit.,2,"....and differently from the Alienware, I saved about 90 dollars.Love the fact you can switch the LEDs off to save battery, also good battery is rechargeable (although in about 3 weeks I never had to charge it yet) good quality and fun to use.Also awfully cheap, which is always a plus!Not sure if is a good match for gaming, I've used it in the new MS flight simulator and I must say the response was fine...Not sure though if it would be fast enough for the ""kill 'em all"" gamesTotally recommended.",91,5.0,2021,06,June,08

Must buy!,2,"Okay, here we go..  I was really excited to get this and try it out. I want to note that I wasn't expecting much since it is pretty inexpensive; however, my excitement didn't last long. The dpi will not change on the one I got, so I changed my mouse settings on my PC. This very, VERY minimally helped. -I couldn't help but laugh while doing this because that curser is sliiiiiiiic......ccccck!For some, this may fit comfortably in their hand, but not mine. Also, it goes to ""sleep"" QUICKLY - as in 5.6 seconds quick. Yes, I timed it.Unfortunately, I'll have to try to return this since I won't use it... ever. By ""try to return it,"" I mean try to actually remember to take it to the post office (or wherever I need to take it) because that never actually happens.In closing, if you have small hands, you're looking for a super slick (meaning super fast) mouse that you may or may not be able to change the dpi, you'll only use it once... maybe twice a year, and you're good at taking your returns where they need to go to get returned, then go for it! Otherwise, maybe look into a different one. Also, I gave 2 stars since is was inexpensive.",214,5.0,2021,06,June,07

Not enough charge,3,"I don't use it for gaming that's why I give it three stars for that, haven't used sleep mode and don't plan on it so I gave it three stars not using that either. The three stars for ergonomics is accurate because it could be a little bit taller and we both have tiny hands, will be small for someone with large hands for sure.

Too high maintenance for a mouse.",69,5.0,2021,06,June,03
Light weight and easy to handle,6,I liked using this mouse but it needed charged a lot more than anticipated.

Sux,1,I purchased this mouse because I needed a new one for my work from home station. I came across this mouse and read some of the reviews and thought I would take a chance on it.

I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in search of a wireless mouse.!,83,2.0,2021,06,June,01
Comfortable and rechargeable!,3,The mouse was surprisingly lightweight. I am accustomed to the wireless mice that are battery powered and it makes a huge difference. It is super sensitive too. I was able to use it on fabric and on wood directly without issue. My old mouse required a mouse pad. The lights can be left on or turned off but you still see the red glow of the sensor when lights are turned off. The USB receiver was easily found underneath. It was a bit difficult to pull out but using my nails it came out pretty quick. It also comes with the USB c adapter which you don't see often but I believe it would work with a Chromebook? or maybe with a USB c charger? It has everything I need and it is crazy how lightweight this thing is!,139,5.0,2021,06,June,01

Great product,2,Love how it looks and feels but out the box it was really glitchy. I charged it and saw that it was still sticking a bit as I was using it. Since it's a mouse the one thing it should do is move smoothly ya know? I don't know if this was just this one mouse or it's how it runs. Either way it's really annoying when you're trying to get things done.,73,5.0,2021,05,May,30
It's silent,2,"I was looking to buy a portable mouse for travel, and was going to buy a regular battery one but saw this pop up as an option. I really like the mint green color. It’s affordable, easy to use, connects fast, and very low profile. The clicker is quiet too. Scroller works great as well. I charged it up connected via USB to my dock station and it was ready to go. Love it.",74,5.0,2021,05,May,30
Not the best mouse out there.,6,Used for daily use. Nice product,6,3.0,2021,05,May,30
Cute and works great!,4,Wasn't terrible but I prefer gaming mice with at least the two buttons on the side,16,5.0,2021,05,May,08
No more batteries,3, Love it,2,5.0,2021,05,May,08
Broke within a week,4,The mouse is light weight and I like the colors. It is also smooth and charge lasts for a while. However I just bought it in May and today in August the usb broke off in the usb port of my computer. The metal part detached from the plastic part. Disappointed.,51,1.0,2021,05,May,29
The best mouse,3,So I bought this a few days ago and the first day of using it which was yesterday (6/8/21) the color changing lights worked and now (6/9/21) only the red light works. This is bs!!! I turned it off for 40 mins to give it a rest but nope the lights still don’t work 2/10 don’t recommend,57,5.0,2021,05,May,29
Disappointed with product. Unable to return for replacement.,8,"Very glitch-y.  Curser tracking is not smooth at all.  Silent buttons are almost too sensitive and frequently ""click"" when I'm not meaning to do so.I threw out this item after only 3 days.",33,2.0,2021,05,May,29
Bad batteries,2,"Gorgeous and very affordable. The battery doesn't last very long, but it's easy to charge while using.",17,2.0,2021,05,May,29
I loved this mouse until...,5,"I was so happy with this mouse when I first got it. Very comfortable, loved the light and most of all the wireless feature. The love affair however was short-lived. After using the mouse for only 2 months it stopped working. I would charge it, it would run for 5 minutes then dead again. It got to the point that the only way the mouse would work is if I kept it plugged - therefore defeating the wireless feature.",79,1.0,2021,05,May,29
BEST MOUSE,2,"Love the design. After two weeks, it has started to fail again (this is my 2nd one). Hoping it's just a fluke!",22,5.0,2021,05,May,29
Good product,2,"This mouse was purchased for use with my laptop. I've purchased two of the same brand previously, but wanted something different so I took a chance on this unknown. The mouse is light, and ergonomic - I have a fairly small hand and it fits well. Connection was simple. The sleep mode will definitely increase battery life. Add to this the pretty lights, and lovely rose color...I'm pleasantly surprised! I would recommend this mouse to anyone who wants an inexpensive, and uncomplicated, addition to their setup.",86,5.0,2021,05,May,29
It  works.,2,Size is just right for me,6,5.0,2021,05,May,28
Awesome!,1,"I like that it recharges and doesn't require batteries.  It doesn't last that long though.  but seems to recharge good enough after only being plugged in for even 5 minutes.  I wish it came with a longer charge cord since you could then use also with charging cable plugged in  ( still can, but very short cord)",57,5.0,2021,05,May,28

"Light and portable, but with a few annoying flaws.",9,"The product fits well in my hand and has a quiet click but it keeps on cutting out. I will walk away for a minute and the mouse does not work anymore so I have to unplug it, turn it off, then back on and replug it in.",48,3.0,2021,05,May,27

Like it,2,It works great! I love it! My son uses it aswell for roblox,13,5.0,2021,05,May,26
Just a light tap to right and left click,9,"The color wasn’t like the photo. It’s a bit darker than what I was expecting (see photo for reference). I did love that the mouse came with a USB to USB-C adapter. The part that connects to the computer for wireless capabilities was “stuck” so I had to use excessive force to remove it. Only other thing I could change is the LED colors. It goes through series of colors, but it would be fun to be able to choose what color it could be.",85,5.0,2021,05,May,26
Great Mouse,2, I love the fact that this thing is quiet as a mouse(Lol).  I hate the clicking sound on other mouses.  The other thing I love is that it's rechargeable! No batteries.  The only con I could find is that it is not an ergonomic mouse.  That's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars.,55,5.0,2021,05,May,26
Not upgraded,2,IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME TO CHARGE THE MOUSE AS TO USE IT.  NOT PRACTICAL.  OTHERWISE THE MOUSE WORKSand it is  ERGONOMICAL,22,1.0,2021,05,May,26

Best mouse I have ever had!!!!,6,"I was looking for a mouse to replace my old wireless one with which the scroll wheel wasnt working anymore and found this one.  I am pleasantly surprised by this mouse.  The click is very quiet yet there is a satisfying tactile feel to it, though the right click can be a bit sensitive but nothing too major. I think the best feature of this mouse is that it is rechargeable.  Very convenient.  The mouse can be used while charging and only took about 1.5 hours to fully charge.  There is a led indicator that turns off to show when the mouse is done charging.  The mouse will also go into sleep mode after 10 minutes of inactivity to save power.  Overall, great mouse.",124,5.0,2021,05,May,26
Very nice design and shape.,5,"I researched Amazon for a wireless mouse and found this one.  I bought it to use with a new laptop.  It works great.  It is responsive, easy to use and saves me time tinkering with the laptops built in mouse.  Another plus is no more batteries to buy.  Happy to have this.",52,5.0,2021,05,May,26

Still going strong,3,"Tried on multiple surface and no matter what i do, the pointer is erratic.  It also NEVER goes into sleep mode.

Very disappointed.",59,5.0,2021,05,May,24

Great,1,purchased this March 29th 2021 only lasted 2 months.Was great while it worked but then 2 days ago it just stopped working.I thought I somehow plugged it in wrong and it didn't charge so charged it back up for two days.Went to use it today and after 30 min it stopped working again. I only use this for work.

Disappointed,1,"Originally liked the idea of not having to use batteries. Tried using this mouse for about a week. When finished using it, I forgot to plug it in. So the next time I tried to use it, the power was zapped. That pretty much defeats the purpose of having a cordless mouse. With no power, had to use it when plugged into my laptop. Sent it back and got a mouse that requires on battery.",75,1.0,2021,05,May,09
Pretty with some kinks,4,Works great,2,3.0,2021,05,May,09
Warning,1,"Very cheaply made. It was the biggest waste of my money. The piece that plugs into the USB port broke in a weeks time as I was taking it out of the port. It can be glued back together but it would have to be done with precision and carefulness not to get glue all over it. I dont know that its worth it. I guess this is one of those things that its just better off going with the brand you trust and paying that little bit extra for something you know is not going to come apart because it was poorly constructed.It was pretty cool how it lights up. It is very lightweight as well, which I will leave that to your own interpretation.",126,1.0,2021,05,May,22
CHANGING MY REVIEW: DO NOT BUY,6,I use it plugged in as the battery life is ok but not amazing... but does what it’s supposed to do.. great addition to my workspace and very comfortable on the hand,32,5.0,2021,05,May,21
Would buy it again,4,I like the fact that it's micro USB instead of swapping AAA battery and it's very light weight and soft and easy to use,24,5.0,2021,05,May,21
Almost worthless!,2,Very satisfying to use and look at but after a couple months the scroll wheel started being super rough and squeaky. Good value though.,24,1.0,2021,05,May,21

Cant keep a charge,4,"Product worked great for 1st 3 months, now the USB charging port is bad and since it's a rechargable mouse it's useless now. Led lights were cool and the mouse felt great ergonomically with soft quiet clicks. Being optical vs laser, it isn't for gaming and battery wouldn't last all day clicking. It also went into sleep mode too quickly and having to click without knowing where the arrow to turn it on turned into a hassle.",77,1.0,2021,05,May,20

Edited:  I Do Like Product,5,The mouse is very cute and i love the colors and the way it lights up. I went to use it one day and it was out of charge (I charged it). I doubt this will last long. It was $15 but really worth about  $5.,46,4.0,2021,05,May,19

It's Not Bluetooth!,3,This mouse was awful!! It worked for a few minutes and then stopped working. You’d have to turn it off and back on again for it to work for a minute. I changed the battery twice. Do not purchase.,39,3.0,2021,05,May,19
Easy to Use and very comfortable mouse,7,"I loved this product but, when I went to remove it from the usb slot, the inner part broke off inside the computer.",23,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Cool Mouse,2,"I have already ordered the black one and liked it so much, I orderer another one for my laptop!",19,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Great mouse!,2,"The device looks and feels good.  The left clicker is very sensitive and mandates that under normal use you keep your hand off of the top of the mouse on the left side or you will accidently left click.  The coloring is good looking, but it is difficult to determine when you need to recharge.  the short charging cord connects to the computer, so you must leave the computer on while recharging the mouse, which is inconvenient.  but the control of the curser is good, although occasionally it seems to ""jump"" to a different place on the screen...still not sure why that happens.  But it is decent value for the money once you teach yourself it's ""quirks.""",117,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Great for fire tablet,4,As described,2,5.0,2021,05,May,18
Excellent mouse.  price quality.,4,I read a lot of the reviews before I decide to buy this item.  So far I have no regrets. People complain about the mouse turning off and the lights being on.  So when I got the mouse noticed that there was an off button for the lights. If you think about it you are saving power when your not using it.  I would recommend the product.,67,5.0,2021,05,May,18

Arrived Broken,2,No complaint!,2,1.0,2021,05,May,17
Already useless,2,Actually changed my mind on this mouse. The one I was using was driving me crazy because the clicking was so loud. I broke this one out of the box and it's pretty cool. It changes colors and it's silent. I can work with the size being slimer.,48,1.0,2021,05,May,17

Easy to Use-poorly designed (updated review),6,It charged up the first time and didn’t charge up again after that. And the replacement batteries for it cost more than the mouse itself. Very cool looking tho.,29,1.0,2021,05,May,16
This is a great item!,5,I've had this mouse for almost 2 weeks now and and loved it until just yesterday the scroll wheel developed a loud grinding a popping sound every time you use it. I will definitely be sending this junk back and get something else.,43,5.0,2021,05,May,15
Headache from colors,3,"This is the first mouse I have bought for my new PC, probably the best purchase I have made for my PC. It's great to use anywhere, it's so quiet and smooth looking, It fits in the palm of my hand nicely, the colors are a bit off but great for how cheap it was! I really like that It was cheap too, but it wasn't cheaply made or seemed like it. I 9/10 recommend! It was a bit trickcy to figure out how to connect it to my PC, I do have both USBC and USB on here but keep in mind that if you have a USB PC you will have to take out the connecter in the mouse, its hard to get it out of though! DO SAVE THE BOX FOR THE USBC CONNECTOR AND CHARGER!",139,2.0,2021,05,May,15
Clicking is actually silent 🤐,5,works well,2,5.0,2021,05,May,15

Low quality mice,3,Looks & feels great! Love all the colors!,8,1.0,2021,05,May,14
Beautiful lights and quiet mouse that works great,8,"I really like the feel and look of this mouse. I love the matte feel, and the lights. Its also very quiet and not clicky, I wasn't expecting that for the price!The only issue I have is that if you use it with a laptop and remove the receiver often, the receiver will come apart. Im not techy enough to figure out how to make it stay together (with glue??, idk) whenever I take it out, the USB drive and the black part separate, and its hard to take the drive out of my computer when that happens. Frustrating. Will say that it lasted a couple months before that happened though.. if you use it with a pc and never remove it,, itll last longer.. i just wish I could get a replacement receiver; I don't want to throw the mouse away if the receiver is the only issue with it. I got it in February 2021 and I noticed that it glitches a bit if its not on a mouse pad or about to die, which can be annoying but manageable;the mouse charges very quickly!",186,5.0,2021,05,May,14
You,1,"I really like this item, it is a lot better than the other ones I was using, great for gaming, charges quickly and easy to get started with and It fits my small hand perfectly. Would definitely recommend this product.",40,5.0,2021,05,May,14
DOES NOT WORK,3,"I absolutely love this mouse! Super handy dandy because not only does it work with my Mac it also works with my work laptop which is a dell. The only thing I don’t like about it is that if you don’t use it for a while, it shuts off. I mean it’s great because it saves energy so you don’t have to charge it often but meh. I’ve yet to charge it again. I used it for 2 days for at least 10 hours each day.",86,1.0,2021,05,May,14
happy,1,Clicking the right and left stick and it's is slow to catch click. Cheap yes but as they say you get what you pay for. Cute yes.. but not worth the frustration.,32,4.0,2021,05,May,14
This mouse moves!,3,The mouse worked fine for the few minutes i got to use it. The USB charging cord was missing. Per the instructions you cannot use any other charging cord with it.,31,5.0,2021,05,May,14
So far so good!,4,"It's light and the texture is nice but there are a few flaws. The mouse can tilt forward lifting the back off the table since there's a lot of surface area past where it touches the surface of the table. The mouse is small, which is nice for portability, but for my hand size it gets uncomfortable after a while. The battery charge is good and the lights aren't too harsh. But by far the most annoying flaw is that it doesn't maintain a constant mouse button press. So if you have to hold and drag something, it will just randomly unclick even though you still have the button pressed. I tested this a lot and it always, without fail stops holding down on the computer. This is unplayable for some games where you have to hold down one of your mouse buttons. Perhaps I just received a faulty mouse, but for the price it's hard to complain too much.",160,5.0,2021,05,May,14
😭,1,Absolutely amazing product! I cant get use it enough especially with the color light feature. The scroll bar is very smooth and the mouse itself fits perfectly in your hand.

Big gash in it,4,"First the price is very affordable, it’s light weight and it works very well. The perfect part is it doesn’t make any sound. Love the product. I am very satisfied",30,1.0,2021,05,May,13
Great product,2,"This mouse is ergonomic, light weight, and very easy to use. Unfortunately the color shown in the picture for rose gold was not very accurate, it is much darker. I would still buy it again though.",36,5.0,2021,05,May,13
No need for batteries,4,"I bought this for my daughter and initially she said she loved it.  Then, she stopped using it and went back to her old mouse.  I left my mouse at work and borrowed this one.  Now I know why she doesn’t use it.  It constantly disconnects and I have to turn it on and off to get it to work.  Then, it randomly tracks on the screen when I am not moving it...it seems like someone else is controlling my computer.  Unsettling.  This mouse is junk...very pretty junk.",88,4.0,2021,05,May,13
Disappointing,1, This is so cute. I love how it changes colors. It is small but not too small.,17,1.0,2021,05,May,13
Works great,2,This was such a great buy. Way better than my microsoft mouse. I'm soooo happy I bought this. The light features are really nifty. I haven't really touched it but I'm just so impressed with now smooth it works on surfaces and on the computer. I'm in love,48,5.0,2021,05,May,13
Bad Mouse dont buy,4,Works good for a laptop,5,1.0,2021,05,May,13
Works great only one hiccup,5,Love how lightweight it is. Just a light tap to right and left click. Mouse tracks greats and the led lights are cute plus it’s pink and priced super! I brought this one for my work PC and I’m buying a second one for my MacBook ...  💕,48,4.0,2021,05,May,13
Extremely satisfied customer,3,Perfect fit to my hand and matches my headphones!!,9,5.0,2021,05,May,13
"It looks nice, is light & small.",7,"We bought this as a replacement for our son, for school work. He had the old version and it worked really well, but he dropped it one to many times and broke (lasted @ 1yr).  This one @a couple weeks into school work the cursor started to drift for no reason. My son is in the 5th grade, no drops, tried several differ backgrounds. Nothing worked, so my husband tried out the mouse, still does not work. Not upgraded, waisted our money and frustrated the whole house withe the uncontrollable drift.",91,5.0,2021,05,May,13
Love it!,2,"Started out pretty nice but after 3.5 weeks the mouse no longer tracks properly. Even after charging all night, after about 3 minutes of use the cursor refuses to respond to the mouse movements.Update: The vendor keeps sending me emails asking me to delete this review for $30- I'm guessing they don't want me to write this on the review but I've told them no three times now and they just sent another one.  I've told them that it's unethical. I've told them its completely against the spirit of reviews in the first place. And there's another one in my inbox. *sigh* I guess I just forward another one to the Customer Service Department of AMazon.",116,5.0,2021,05,May,12
Its a flat mouse with led lights on the edges and the laser light blinks like crazy,17,It is just ok product for me. It could be more finished product but its not. Sometime it seems like its not clicking at all. Lights are good but for performance i give it three stars.,36,5.0,2021,05,May,12
Pretty good mouse and super quiet,6,"Very good, come back if need to",7,5.0,2021,05,May,12
Great,1,This mouse is amazing its super quiet when clicking and it runs smooth even on bed sheets. It works on any surface!,22,5.0,2021,05,May,12

Great for every day use.,5,I am pleasantly pleased with this mouse. It’s attractive looking and works very well. It comes with a USB C adapter along with the charging cable in case you need one. Plug and play actually worked. No complaints about this mouse and would purchase again if I need an additional one.,51,4.0,2021,05,May,11
Finally a comfortable mouse,4,This mouse works well for my needs and fits in my (medium-sized) hands well. This is the first mouse I've ever owned with a built-in rechargeable battery and now I don't ever want to own one without it. The small form factor is also nice for packing up and taking on the go. Another nicely designed element is that the nano-receiver tucks into the bottom of the mouse and doesn't require prying off a cover or any extra effort to remove or insert.,83,3.0,2021,05,May,11
Broke within the first week of use,7,"This is the best wireless mouse I've ever used.  The flat profile keeps my arthritic hand from getting stiff and sore after long use.  The colors are subtle enough to be fun but not intrusive.  If you plan to use it with a desktop computer, be aware that the charging cord is very short, so using the mouse while charging may be a problem.  I use it with a laptop, where this is not an obstacle.  The mouse appears very well made and sturdy.",84,1.0,2021,05,May,11
My bad - was not easy to find,8,"Works good for a child, not  for people with arthritis",10,4.0,2021,05,May,11

Adapter doesn’t fit my computer,5,I love this mouse. It’s VERY smooth. If I had one complaint it would be that it will be dead in the morning if you don’t plug it up before you leave work. But sometimes I just forget to plug it up when I leave so that’s my fault.,49,1.0,2021,05,May,11

Quality responsive mouse,3,"I have been using this mouse for about a month, it had been working perfectly. I only use it occassionally throughout the day.

Great product,2,"Bought for my 6th grader to use in school with her laptop on a daily basis.  She’s used this for quite sometime now with no issues, and she’s very rough on her things.",33,5.0,2021,05,May,10
"Comfortable, clean cut",3,Great product!! Would highly recommend!,5,5.0,2021,05,May,10
Awesome buy,2,"I gave it two stars because I like glowing lights (can you tell I’m a child of the 80s?); if I could give it zero stars for function, I would. This mouse has a lot of good reviews - maybe mine is a fluke. It is, however, fairly horrible. The charge on the battery is extraordinarily short-lived and when charged, it sort of sucks then too.",66,5.0,2021,05,May,10
smooth on a wood table,5,"Really disappointed with this product. I loved it when I got it. It fit my hand nicely worked like a dream, then it came time to charge it. No matter where I plugged it in I could not get it to charge. Not sure if it is just a faulty product or if this is just how they are.",59,4.0,2021,05,May,10

does not move smoothly,4,"The reliable range is less than 18 inches.  At 4 feet, you usually have  to click repeatedly.  Control of the moving arrow was sporadic.  I thought something was wrong with my computer until I bought a new mouse, which works fine.",41,2.0,2021,05,May,07
"Sleek, noiseless but ....",4,"Its nice not having to buy batteries all the time for my mouse. Only downside is when I don't move the mouse for a while, you have to click the button to wake it up, sometimes it clicks on the screen and clicks on something I didn't want to click on or open.Update: it died 3 months later. Not worth it.",61,3.0,2021,05,May,07
Love it,2,The mouse lasted one day. I changed the battery. It still wont turn on. URRGGGG!,15,5.0,2021,05,May,07
Very sturdy,2,"Mouse is pretty solid all around. Except..About a day after I started using it the wheel started squeaking, figure it might go away in time. Nope.. 2 months later still squeaking and getting more irritating by the day. Working in an quiet office it is loud enough that other people can hear it.",53,4.0,2021,05,May,07

Great product for the office,5,"I was naive and thought ""wireless"" meant ""bluetooth"", but it doesn't. Make sure you read everything carefully! The colours change really smoothly, though.",23,5.0,2021,05,May,06

Great Mouse,2,"I like this mouse, works very good, the dpi button do it work. Is very silent, and you can turn off the color light. Very recommended.",26,5.0,2021,05,May,05

Not very good product,4,"8/30/2021- Wanted to update my review. Not only did this not last AT ALL I have received MULTIPLE emails from the distributor asking to remove my review, promising an amazon gift card. They gave multiple excuses of why the item doesn't work. Clearly from all the recent reviews of this item, they have not fixed any of it. I get almost daily emails from them asking to remove my review. DO NOT buy this item, you will regret it!I was loving this mouse. Sleek design. Loved the rechargeable feature of it. Until one day I came into work, booted up my laptop and the mouse was no longer connecting to the computer. Tried to take out the USB of the computer, and part of it was left stuck in the computer. I am now going to have to try to get the piece out of the usb port on my laptop. And how about that, my return window ended last week. VERY frustrated and annoyed by this. I would not recommend this item.",173,1.0,2021,05,May,04
Okay for money. High-pitched noise,5,The mouse does well. I use it daily for work. It lasts a long time between charges and puts itself to sleep when I am not using it so battery is not wasted. Sometimes I can go 2 weeks without charging. My only complaint is the wheel. I have had it about 4 months and the wheel started squeaking recently. People can hear it in my calls and it sometimes drives me nuts. This is my 3rd wireless mouse (the other 2 were different kinds and the wheel stopped working at all- was a common complaint on those).,98,3.0,2021,05,May,04

Great Mouse,2,I love this mouse. I got the teal and i used it for the first time today. I’m in love!,20,5.0,2021,03,March,19
Great find!,2,"Love the slimline appearance and the changing colors. The colors add a sense of fun to a normally mundane piece of computer equipment. Also love the ability to keep it one color (red) or allow it to change colors and the ability to change the speed of the cursor. Good product, well designed. Make sure you are aware of the button on the bottom as it is not just an on/off switch, but has three positions. THIS IS NOW OCTOBER 2021, This mouse broke after little use while traveling. The scroll wheel broke inside the mouse making it useless. This appears to be a poor design and a weak point in this item and I would now not recommend it. I have had other computer mice for years without this issue.",131,5.0,2021,05,May,04
Great! Super helpful product,4,This product works great!!,4,5.0,2021,05,May,04
Stops working,2,You can’t turn off the colors!!! It lights up the entire time you’re using it. I bought the white mouse of this brand and I love that one,28,2.0,2021,05,May,04
Best purchase,2,"There really isn’t anything to dislike about this mouse. The setup process is virtually non- existent, you just plug in the usb and you’re good to go. I have been using it for more than a week and I haven’t had to charge it yet. The light display is a neat added bonus, great for dark room adventures 😎. Long story short, it does what I expected, but better. Great buy.",71,5.0,2021,05,May,04

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!,4,"This is the first day of use, but the mouse looks nice, I got flat black, I like that there are no batteries. Charged quickly and super easy to start using. Its light and fits my small hand nicely. The lights are nice as well and not annoying. I like that they can be turned off. I don't plan on using the mouse for gaming so I will not know how well it works for that sort of thing.. for me just basic computer work, Photoshop & Lightroom and I think it will do nicely for those.. it seems quick and is working well even without a mouse pad. I think it was for sure worth the price so far. Its a nice basic mouse I think.",127,5.0,2021,04,April,30
What a fun mouse,4,This mouse is very quiet like it says in the description. Pretty. The only thing I worry about is it is very lightweight. The quality seems cheap. But it hasn’t proved that yet. I will only use it for office work so hopefully it will not wear out or go defective.,51,5.0,2021,04,April,30
Great!,1,Works right out of the box has the charging cable and both USB options so you can use it on different comps older and new. The lights are really cool too :),32,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Good buy,2,Its really light weight and you don't hear the mouse clicks. However the usb blutooth is located at the bottom of the mouse.  I didn't have tough enough finger nails to pull the usb out.  Logitech has their blutooth in the mouse where the battery is located but this didn't have a visible battery.  So I used the tip of a knife to pop the usb out.  Almost nicked my hand from the blade getting the usb out.  You may do a better job than me.,86,5.0,2021,04,April,29

Not durable enough for kids,5,Super comfortable to use!!,4,2.0,2021,03,March,19
Quiet and stylish,3,"There's really nothing to dislike about it, I love the fact that I don't have to run out and buy batteries every time it starts to act like it's not going to work. The way it charges is one of the main reasons that I bought it. I'd rather save the $$ for batteries and get something else instead of worrying if I have enough spare batteries. I have a mouse pad that has a ""breathing"" mode and the mouse goes along with its own pattern to make the two of them an excellent night light of sorts. For the amount spent, I'd give this mouse a 10+. I also love the fact that it's easy to pack it up with my laptop and go anywhere without worrying (again) if my mouse will run out of power. I think that there should be more accessories that can charge from a USB port rather than lugging around extra batteries.",158,5.0,2021,04,April,29

That it works,3,"This is an awesome mouse!  It is a slender build so it fits a small hand & the lights are totally fun.  When you click the buttons, it is a strong click so that you know you have clicked on something, it, also, has a quick response on the computer.  It has an off & on switch plus an automatic shut off so you won't use up the batteries.  I will be buying one for my daughter, it is awesome.",80,5.0,2021,04,April,29
Super cool!,2,"I find this mouse easy to use, fits my hand very well (wear a medium sized glove) and moves fairly smoothly.  I say fairly smooth because I used a mouse pad with a smooth soft surface.  It seemed to drag just a little. When I tried a smooth hard surface it worked better.  You do have to click a button to ""wake up"" the mouse when it goes to sleep mode.  My other one woke up with just moving it.  I thought that maybe the changing lights around the mouse would be distracting but I dont even notice it.  I would probably buy again.",104,5.0,2021,04,April,28

Very Cool Product,3,"Really disappointed. I wanted to love this product, but the USB-C adapter that came with it doesn’t fit into my USB-C port. It looks like it only goes half way in. So basically the product is useless :(The mouse itself was pretty and easy to manipulate. Wish the adapter worked",50,5.0,2021,04,April,28
Don't hesitate to buy,4,My home schooling student enjoyed the lights but it has stopped working entirely after 4 months. Too late to return. So fun for awhile but don't expect it to last.,30,5.0,2021,04,April,28
Love this mouse for ease and color :),8,"I love this mouse so much I bought another one. I love the soft click, that it is rechargeable, and the lights are great. Easy to install, just stick the USB dongle into the computer and Starr using. Probably the best mouse I’ve had.",44,5.0,2021,04,April,28
The mouse stopped working after one week. I got no response from their customer service.,15,"Item must’ve been defective or something because in 2 was it stopped working, charging and pretty much would o my work at will.Also the returns process with this vendor sucks. It’s not via Amazon. Had to go twice to UPS because I had to print the label or pay $3.50 to print on site. Then had to also buy an envelope to ship it back in.If I would’ve paid a little bit more for a higher quality, would thane had to waste more time and money with the hassle. Save yourself the grief and get one a little bit more upscale.",101,2.0,2021,04,April,28
Satisfied,1,Didn't work.,2,5.0,2021,04,April,28

Nice look and feel.,4,Smooth clicking.  Ran out of battery quickly so shut it off when not in use.,15,4.0,2021,04,April,28

Great mouse!,2,I bought this for my new laptop because I really don't like the finger pads on laptops.It is truly plug-and-play and works awesome! plus it looks really sleek.,28,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Dies after 2 days of use,6,Nice colorful LED mouse that is still tethered to a cord when in use for a while,17,1.0,2021,04,April,27
I like it,3,The wheel/roller makes click vibrations and makes scrolling take longer. I would love it otherwise.,15,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Only worked for 30 days,5,Stopped working a day and a half after I got it. I’ve charged it and everything and it just won’t work. Good for the couple of hours that I did use it I thought the lights were pretty. So I give it two stars for having pretty lights but no other stars because it was a waste of my money since it no longer works.,65,1.0,2021,04,April,27
Short life,2,Greatest,1,4.0,2021,04,April,27
Great buy,2,Love the quietness and how light it is,8,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Poor battery life,3,Won’t stay charged!,3,2.0,2021,04,April,27
Not very happy with the product,6,Really like this mouse (never thought I’d say that..)It stores the USB port in its belly when you need to disconnect which is super helpful for someone who loses small pieces. It’s a quiet click which I appreciate even when working alone. And the rainbow lighting is optional.Win win win.It’s light too as it’s rechargeable! I carry it with my laptop and it’s made working on the go better,69,3.0,2021,04,April,18
"Great mouse, inexpensive cost",4,"It's a pretty mouse! Just some notes.-Plastic a bit thin at the top so the color bleeds through more than the pic. It's fine, just an aesthetic thing.- mouse wheel a bit noisy now after some use. squeeks and screetches some when scrolling.-battery life is fine. .glad i can use it when charging .- sensitivity is off. cursor moves quickly randomly as if its spazzing out. thought this was a battery issue but it happens when fully charged sometimes.Overall it's fine but I shouldve just bought something a bit sturdier even if it was pricier. gonna keep using it to get my moneys worth!",104,5.0,2021,04,April,27
Do not waste your time,5,The mouse is so fast and good!  Got the silver color and its so pretty especially at night. Easy set up,21,1.0,2021,04,April,26
Too fragile,2,I got this for my sister for her birthday to go with her new laptop and she absolutely loves it. Very easy to use and adorable,26,3.0,2021,04,April,26
Nice mouse,2,"I love this, no more batteries, and I love how it lights up...",13,5.0,2021,04,April,26
Good deal,2,This mouse is garbage. Buyer beware. Doesn't hold a charge. Doesn't move the cursor. Bought 2 for 2 separate computers and its the same for both. Amazon basics mouse is 1000% better,32,4.0,2021,04,April,26
blinky laser and poor performance,5,Lightweight. Easy bluetooth connection. The glow adds an extra pizzazz.😄,10,1.0,2021,04,April,26
Plain simle garbage,3,"Worked great for about 1 week. Now won't work. Love the color and that it was a ""quiet click"" but disappointed that it died.",24,1.0,2021,04,April,26
"Blue tooth enabled, quick to start, minimum power usage.",9,Product did not move smoothly across the mouse pad and did not fit my hand particularly well.,17,5.0,2021,04,April,25
I love tjis mouse!,4,....not so great with the rendering. Dragging objects with the mouse is not so great. Especially acrosss screens. I work on visio a lot and its just very hard to get this to drag stuff around. So basically has a bad sensor. But its smooth and very quiet.,48,5.0,2021,04,April,25
Great product,2,I absolutely love my mouse. It's good quality and last a pretty long time before needing a charge.,18,5.0,2021,04,April,25
Disappointed,1,"Not bad, rechargeable and portable. Highly recommend",7,1.0,2021,04,April,25
Very cheap!,2,Don’t buy this! You have to charge it every day. You might as well have a mouse with a cord because that’s what it ends up being. It does not take a battery and Hass to be charged all the time.,41,1.0,2021,04,April,25
Turn it off when not in use or the battery will die,12,"Battery lasts forever, smooth and sleek design. If you use the middle mouse button, it's a little hard to click, but that's literally the only downside. Would recommend this mouse to anyone else looking for an affordable sleek mouse.",39,4.0,2021,04,April,25
Cute but not that reliable,5,Nice and soft but the laser isn’t very accurate,9,2.0,2021,04,April,25
Stopped working in less than a year,7,"The mouse worked immediately but stopped responding after 2 minutes. No troubleshooting worked, laptop recognized the dongle the whole time, but couldn't move the cursor or click. Tried on an additional computer and still no luck.",36,2.0,2021,04,April,24
Good value,2,It is really quite except that the scroll button when you click it is really loud. RGB is decent for the price but I wish it was brighter. Overall its decent,31,5.0,2021,04,April,24
Stays Red on all Settings,5,Love this mouse. Love that I don't need to use batteries anymore. It's comfortable to use as well,18,1.0,2021,04,April,23

long battery life,3,The mouse will not charge. And it feels cheaply made.,10,5.0,2021,04,April,21
"Doesn’t work well, had to return",6,Broken right after ran out of return window came . The narrow keep moving and linking event when is using or not using it. Don’t know what problem with it.,30,1.0,2021,04,April,21
Good Mouse Excellent Price,4,"This mouse does what it needs for the most part. However, the cursor itself will jump all over the page from time to time which is annoying.",27,5.0,2021,04,April,21
I'm satisfied!,2,"The one I'm currently using has been dropped a number of times, & is currently wrapped with scotch tape.  I wanted new one in the  event the older one gives up & quits on me.  And with this newer, sleeker one it has a splace for the USB connector to be stored (for travel purposes), on the underside of the mouse.  Another great feature, I think!",66,5.0,2021,04,April,21
NO REGRET,2,"I love this mouse! I actually purchased two because of the look, but they are great! I use one at my home office and one at my office.",28,5.0,2021,04,April,21
DOES NOT WORK,3,"This mouse is rechargeable, which is great, except that it doesn't hold a charge. I charged it all night and the next day, it died after using it for 5 minutes. I would not recommend this item and will go back to a wireless mouse that uses batteries.",48,1.0,2021,04,April,21
LOVE the colors!  Super quiet!,5,The battery life on this mouse is terrible.  It lasts maybe a day to a day and a half without recharging. Also a bit small and the grip is slippery.  I would not recommend it to anyone.,37,5.0,2021,04,April,20
Love it!,2,"I love the mouse, but sometimes it randomly stops working and my computer won’t recognize it. I noticed it did this when I used the changing color settings. I recommend just keeping it on “on” and not the changing colors setting.",41,5.0,2021,04,April,20
It's cool,2,"Great product. Works as advertised, light and cool colors!!",9,5.0,2021,04,April,20

"Nice lighting and easy to use, quiet",7,"It is okay. The scroll wheel and clicker are quiet, but the mouse emits a super high frequency noise any time it moves. I have become aware of it and can't stand using it much anymore.",36,5.0,2021,04,April,20
Works great. It's quiet and small form factor.,8,The mouse stopped working after about a month of use.,10,5.0,2021,04,April,18
How to immediately lose me as a potential buyer,9,This is the best mouse and I love that it is rechargeable. I haven't had a lag problem unlike a mouse that requires batteries. I loved it so much I bought another ❤,33,1.0,2021,04,April,18
Lag,1,The item is supposed to wake up after turning itself off in order to save battery but mine never did. I had to turn it off and then on again.And then after 3 days the cursor began moving wildly by itself and then later that day the buttons stopped working entirely.,51,2.0,2021,04,April,17
Go Ahead & Buy,4,"Finally! The wireless, rechargeable mouse works as advertised. Small, handy, recharging is easy.",13,5.0,2021,04,April,17
Love it,2,Nice Mouse but I have had other rechargeable and this one seriously lacks uptime. I'm getting about a few days and dies quickly. My first one would last weeks but I lost it at a conference.... I should have went back to it...,43,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Cute & light weight!,4,"It worked for 5min and then got stuck in my laptop, looks like made of cheap material",17,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Terrible product,2,This product is useless and the quality is abysmal! I have never complained about any product I purchased from Amazon (or through Amazon) in the last 20 years as a customer. Please inform all your customers that this product is a cheap quality piece of damnation!,46,1.0,2021,04,April,16
It’s just not the right one for me,8,"Worked great for less than a month. Received in April 4 and broke today, May 2. No clue what happened. I went to use it after taking a break for a few hours and it just fell apart and I'm not able to put it back together.",47,1.0,2021,04,April,16
This mouse,2,I wasn't sure what to expect with this mouse but it works perfectly. I never thought I'd be so excited to use a wireless mouse.,25,2.0,2021,04,April,16
Keeps a very good charge.,5,It works okay but is hard to charge.,8,5.0,2021,04,April,16
replaced,1,The metal piece that is attached to the chip on the ubs broke off in my side brand new laptop... talking about being sick,24,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Great,1,"Honestly feels a bit on the cheap side, and compared to other similar makes, the main difference being LED lighting so it adds a 'wow' factor to it. Clicking is also smooth and feels nice, and the top-down view is pleasing. The lighting itself is mostly smooth but blotchy at some points where the color is abrupt rather than a seamless transition.Performance wise it does the job, but ergonomically doesn't feel as form-fitting as a gaming mouse. I'd really use this as a backup work mouse or a home mouse where its just to surf the web. Also the cursor sometimes randomly jumps. First time this has happened on a mouse, so it seems like they really cut costs and marked up the price.If I were to guess the price if I'd seen the product without a price tag, I'd probably say its about 6-7 bucks.",146,5.0,2021,04,April,16
Great mouse for the $ no doubt,7,This was a horrible purchase. I am returning this because it sucked.,12,5.0,2021,04,April,15
You get what you pay for,6,"Developers really did-a-number with this device! This mouse speaks for itself. It is actually just what the marketing team indicated, AWESOME! I am a customizable type of consumer, thus I enjoy my share of intriguing components that of which deviates from the mundane norm. This led mouse Wowed-Me with the illuminating colorful lighting and the smoothness upon usage. Very well crafted and I look forward to purchasing other colors as time progress.",72,2.0,2021,04,April,15
An Issue,2,"This is a great mouse. Quiet, responsive, fun color!",9,1.0,2021,04,April,15
Excellent,1,"The main thing for me is that it is really pretty. Maybe that's just a girl reason to like it but I am a girl. And an artist. And maybe a wee bit eccentric. I want stuff around me to add to my environment, especially now. Other than that, well, its a mouse. It does all the same things other computer mice do and it does it well. And its pretty!",71,5.0,2021,04,April,15
Good purchase!,2,"It’s cool, feels pretty smooth and nice light colors but the battery doesn’t last long.",15,5.0,2021,04,April,15
Avoid this mouse,3,"The USB plug broke and the case around the chip got stuck inside the port. I can pull the USB out but the case stays inside the port. It's still useable if I put it back in though. It also has a very high pitched dog whistle kind of noise when it moves, especially when it's used close to the USB plug. It is not silent... that's for sure. I have to use music or headphones when I use this mouse or it drives me insane.It's shallow depth is kind of hard on my hand, but I have arthritis so I usually need a thicker/taller mouse to fill my palm to be comfortable. But I bought this mouse as a backup for my work laptop, so I don't use it as much as I use my gaming mouse.I like that you can still use it when it's plugged in to charge if you use a longer cable.",157,1.0,2021,04,April,14

I love this mouse!,4,"This mouse arrived yesterday. I plugged it in for 2 hours, per the instructions, and then started to use it. It worked GREAT!Once I got off work, I turned it off and went about my merry way. When I returned and had to check on something, I tried to use it again and it is completely non-responsive. I've tried different USB ports, unplugging and replugging the dongle, and I even charged it overnight to ensure that it had a full charge.It does not work. I was so excited for this mouse. It's slim and quiet, which are both great qualities with the amount of travel that I do while still getting some work done on my vacations... but it's not worth the money. Less than 24 hours later and I'm back to having to use my trackpad because this mouse decided it wasn't going to work any longer.",148,5.0,2021,04,April,12
lasted 2 weeks,3,Will be returning middle track roller does not work. If the mouse sits idle for to long it loses wireless connection  with the computer and  you have to shut it off and turn it back on. The led color changer is cool other than that it's just ok.,48,1.0,2021,04,April,12

Mouse connected right away to my ThinkPad. I ordered the white and the illuminating changing colors look awesome! Mouse is low profile with a really nice feel to it. I tend to run through computer mice pretty quick so only time will tell for Longevity.

Cute But Glitchy,3,I have small hands and this fits perfectly.  Very cute and lightweight,12,3.0,2021,03,March,30
Love!!,1, Sooo this thing is so cute for starters. It’s light weight and without my mouse pad it smooths across surfaces easily. The buttons aren’t hard and actually it’s easier to click on different things.Only negatives I have. When it goes into sleep mode I have to turn it on and off.And the second thing is a pro and con for me. The usb chip to make the mouse work wireless is stored under the mouse. I love it because it makes traveling with this mouse for work super easy. I just wish it had a latch release. I had to use a card to pop it out. Other than those 2 things it’s great! I didn’t even have to charge it when I took it out the box.,128,5.0,2021,03,March,29

Overall it was just an annoying issue.",55,1.0,2021,03,March,27

Great,1,I have had this mouse for about seven days and it is not track well if there’s a delay and it’s only broken the click button has already broken.

"Great value,  works good",4,"This mouse is awesome. It charges quickly and comes with an adapter for the new Apple Mac plug thing.

This mouse is great,4,"I love this mouse! The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because the scroll wheel is opposite. When I scroll forward (away from me) the page goes down and when I scroll backwards (towards me) the page goes up. I'm getting used to it, but I'd rather it just be like a normal mouse. Is there any way to fix this? Or does anyone else have this problem?",72,5.0,2021,03,March,24
Great Product,2, This mouse is lightweight.  It charges fast by a small cable which is included.  It does not take batteries. It puts on a light show of colors fun for adults or children.  This can easily be turned off by a switch on the bottom of the mouse.The mouse itself is easy to assemble.  There is a small usb plug that clips to the bottom of the mouse for storage when you are not using it.  This plugs into your computers usb port when you do use it.This is a great mouse to use as a backup.  The color is great also.Review title:  Great spare mouse,105,4.0,2021,03,March,24
Reasonable price,2,"This is a very nice mouse for my needs. I like how it lights up, especially when I am using it in the dark, which makes it easier to use, and I appreciate that I do not have to buy batteries...worth the purchase.",43,4.0,2021,03,March,24
Led Easy mouse...,3,"For $11, this is the best wireless mouse I’ve ever used. Set it up in two minutes, feels good in my hand, the scrolling wheel is nice and the clicking is silent!

Love it! Super easy to use.,6,"quit working, trashed it",4,5.0,2021,03,March,23
All what you need in a mouse,7,The mouse is super sleek and comfortable for people who like their hands more flat. Super pretty when all lit up and works perfectly! but you better not drop it or drop anything you're carrying it in because it instantly will stop working every 2 minutes you use it there after. I should have expected this from such a cheap mouse but after one minor drop is ridiculous.,68,5.0,2021,03,March,23

Good quality product.,3,Great Product 100% recommended!,4,4.0,2021,03,March,22
Compatible with Microsoft surface pro,5,"The mouse is contained in a Japanese package but was made in China. It comes with the type-c adapter, c-charging/usb cable, regular 2.0 USB mouse receiver, and thin instructions.I've plugged the Type C adapter into two different machines with the same result. Neither laptops read the type c directly or through another adapter. I've also tried another wireless mouse receiver in the type c with the same results. None of them work through this adapter.Other than that issue the mouse works. It also goes to sleep so by clicking the mouse one is able to use it again. The also other nice feature is that it is wireless with no battery included. Just plug in the charging cord into an empty USB slot.The color changing around the rim of the mouse gives a nice touch, and although at first the mouse feels 'long' due to it's sleek shape, it does fit comfortably in the hand. It also has a plastic-like feeling, and on the instructions it says to avoid dropping the mouse so it doesn't malfunction or break.",178,5.0,2021,03,March,22
Nice,1,Very sleek looking. As pictured. I love the color. Good product,11,5.0,2021,03,March,21

Fantastic wireless mouse at an amazing price!,7,It matches my computer,4,5.0,2021,03,March,21
Looks cool and works,4,This mouse has been so much better on my wrists.  It’s sleek new design makes it easier to sit all day without the need to move to another position to relieve the strain on my wrist. I love the rechargeable aspect because I no longer need to struggle with the endless supply of battery replacements. It is so easy to sync up and was ready to go right away. So many colors to choose from too!,76,5.0,2021,03,March,21
Easy to use. Excellent purchase.,5,"The rose gold color is very pretty, and the color changing effect was nice at first but after about an hour of use the colors started to glitch - the back end of the mouse was staying yellow and the front continued to change colors. There is an option to turn the colors off, but you end up with a red light that shows up randomly while moving the mouse around. It will get the job done but also feels very cheap compared to a Logitech or name brand. Get what you pay for in this case.",97,5.0,2021,03,March,21
Just say no.,3, I Like the color. I thought it was going to have changing colored lights. It only close red which was disappointing. It’s also kind of flat and smaller than I expected. Overall I mean does what I need it to do.,41,1.0,2021,03,March,20
Colorful mouse excellent buy,4,"i recently bought a new chromebook and wanted a wireless mouse to match, i came across this mouse and after reading the reviews figured id give it a try, i cant say how good it works yet because i never recieved the usb-c adaptor with it and for some reason cant get it to connect wireless im sure ill figure it out but it wouldve been nice to have the wire option as well. otherwise its slim which is what i wanted and i like the lights on it",89,5.0,2021,03,March,20
Great,1,I love this mouse for the most part. The colors are vivid and it feels nice in my hand. The only downside is that the right click has a tendency to stick even when I am only using the left click. I've had it for a few days now and that's the only negative.,54,4.0,2021,03,March,19
Great choice!,2,This mouse is great for what I use it for I like the RGB effects not really designed for gaming,20,5.0,2021,03,March,19
nice mouse,2,"This mouse has a very poor sensor. It will take several seconds to wake up after being inactive for a bit, and you sometimes have to click the DPI button or mouse buttons several times and shake the mouse for it to wake up. The sensor also cannot move fast. If I try moving the mouse quickly, the cursor gets very spastic and starts curving around the screen like Deja Vu is playing in the background.Speaking of clicks, the left mouse button double clicks quite a bit.The only thing this mouse has going for it is its design. Even then, the design is uncomfortable since its so flat.Find a better mouse. Please. Don't torture yourself with this.",117,5.0,2021,03,March,19
Not sure how to describe see review,7, Works very well. I keep the led light shut off to save battery. I've had it for about a week and haven't needed to charge it yet. I shut it off when not in use. It's so nice not to have a cord to deal with. I want to buy another one I love it so much! The color is gorgeous 😍,62,5.0,2021,03,March,19
Piece of crap!,3,"After I connected this mouse, whole mechanism fXXXXX UP...",9,1.0,2021,03,March,19

It's got a mind of its own!,7,"Every time I use the mouse, there is this high-pitched noise! Hurts my ears",14,2.0,2021,03,March,18
White mouse - Read before purchase,6,"I purchased 2 for our office.  The mouse looked nice and the colors were pretty, but mine started having problems just a few days later.  It was unresponsive and jerky for a few days.  Then it stopped working (despite charging overnight).  I tried charging on different outlets to make sure the outlet wasn't bad, but it wouldn't hold a charge and died again within minutes.  When I asked the other employee about his identical mouse (different color) he said his never seemed to work right and wouldn't hold a charge.  I used the included cord and tried charging with the computer, with a hub, with a power strip, and with a charging block (not included) plugged into multiple outlets.When returning, I packaged the items as requested and requested the pick-up slip.  We found the return slip face down on the ground on the sidewalk several feet in front of our office a few days later- not stuck to the door or in the mailbox mounted next to our front door.  No one knocked to let us know it was delivered and we wouldn't have found it if a staff member hadn't gone out to sanitize the outside door handles.  Now we have to take it to a drop off location because a return pickup is going to cost $7 (despite the package being ready to send before the return sticker was dropped off).  I am unhappy with both the item and the return and have already ordered similar replacements from another seller.",252,3.0,2021,03,March,17
Stopped working,2,"This light up mouse is great, and I've had a few similar ones. I like that this one is rounded on the edges (more aesthetically pleasing, imo).It holds a charge for long enough that it's not annoying, though It would be nice if there was an option to turn the light off while using to save charge even more. The options are just ""on"" (constant red light) or ""*"" (cycles through colors). Clicks are definitely as close to silent as you could get.The only thing that is bothering me is that the wheel is squeaking after only 3 weeks of use. I intend to drop some WD40 onto it and I'm sure that will fix the problem, but I don't think that should be necessary to begin with.Overall a good choice, though!IMMEDIATE UPDATE: Directing WD40 into the ""wheel well"" of the mouse is not easy, even using a pin. Dropped the mouse, and now the wheel doesn't scroll at all, it just spins. Soooooo not great. Removing a star. Either a) accept the squeaky wheel or b) be VERY careful when trying to oil said wheel because if you drop it it will die. UGH",195,2.0,2021,03,March,17

Rainbow Dreams,2,"Just got this last night for my new ACER, when I plugged in the mouse the curser just jumps around (with usb or usb C plug).  It zig-zags across the screen when trying to move in a straight line.  It stops just short of moving to the edges of the screen and you have to move it gently to get it to go anywhere with precision.  I charged it overnight and same results this morning, I adjusted the DPI with the button and it just jumps faster around the screen. I tried troubleshooting but I can use any other mouse in my house and they work just fine so I will be returning this mouse and purchasing something that works.",120,5.0,2021,03,March,13

Best mouse I’ve ever used,5,Super cute mouse. I love the color and I love the LED lights. My only issue is that it's very glitchy. Like it seems to want to do its own thing which isn't good. I sit at a desk for 8 hours and it's a completely flat surface and the mouse will move all on its own.,57,5.0,2021,03,March,08
Comfortable,1,Absolutely love this mouse. If it were to break I would buy this product again!!,15,5.0,2021,03,March,08
Stopped working after a month,5,"Since I mainly draw art, I didn't see a need to have a bulky gaming mouse. This fits perfectly in my hand and has very quiet clicks which is ideal when I'm drawing at night while the family is asleep. The ability to switch between changing colors or just plain mouse mode is very useful for me. I enjoy the fact that you can turn it off with that very switch too as most mice at this price range never have that option! It's a good buy for a casual office or laid back working experience.",96,1.0,2021,03,March,07
Mouse,1,I got this to replace my white one that broke well let’s just say I love it. It stays charged a very long time and the color change is beautiful,30,4.0,2021,03,March,06

Overall good,2,My order came fast and on time. I use this little mouse at work all the time. It is lightweight and slim enough to put in my scrub pocket for travel. Easy to clean. Only thing I see is that I cannot tell when the battery runs low. I keep an extra mouse handy for those times. But other than that no complaints!,63,4.0,2021,03,March,06
Would definitely recommend,3,"I like the design and feel of the mouse.  My concern is that it tends to go to sleep and anytime I have not used it for a few minutes, I have to press the button on top and then it does come right back on.  I guess with time I will learn to do that each time I want to use it.  In use, it does not function as smoothly as I had hoped it would, hesitating to start and then the curser ""hops"" when I am trying to drag it from one place to another.",97,5.0,2021,03,March,06
Great buy for the price. Works amazing!,7,"Great product, very nice and very nice price, my daughter love it!",12,5.0,2021,03,March,05

Nice,1,"I purchased this mouse because I was tired of having to uninstall and re-install a bluetooth mouse I was using.

BE CAREFUL!,2,"UPDATE 1:: Had it charging for less than a minute and the whole house smelled like burning plastic. In that time, the cord got super hot, and the part where it plugged into the mouse was super hot as well. Probably would have caught fire if left unattended.UPDATE 2:: Using different cords was just fine. DO NOT USE THE CORD THAT COMES WITH IT!!!UPDATE 3:: Battery won't hold a charge... I was really wanting this mouse to work, but looks like I'm returning it after all.",86,1.0,2021,02,February,11

Recommended,1,"This is the second time I buy it. It has everything .. no need for battery .. you hock it up to a laptop for charging and that's it.. comfortable while holding it..moving smoothly and got very appealing look. I bought another one from another brand and stopped working after awhile. This one is the real deal and no more exploring other mouses, I'm sticking with it.",67,5.0,2021,02,February,09
stopped working after 24 hours,5,"I bought this mouse, because I saw it was a wireless ""silent"" click. Which was perfect for me working in a class room and not loving to hear the click of a mouse all day. I have dropped it 3 + times and each time I have been able to just move the plastic back into place and ""repair"" so the duriablily from drops is awesome for when I move between classes to see my different classes.",77,1.0,2021,02,February,09
Awesome!,1,Beautiful. My daughter loves it!,5,5.0,2021,02,February,09
Hard at beginning,3,"It makes an almost mute power sound when I use it, which can become annoying when I use it in a silent room. The light also makes the internal part of the mouse visible. Other than that, it works well.",40,4.0,2021,02,February,09

Absolute piece of .... garbage,5,It was a great value. It arrived quickly. It works great. The usb-c doesn't fit my port but the mouse only need usb.,23,1.0,2021,02,February,08
breaks easily,2,"The mouse is really quiet, no clicking sound, which I liked.  Comfortable for the hand. Does not hold a charge very long, and nothing worse than not responding during middle of the work day. I had tried to different brands, the other was one that had bluetooth feature, so I could use it on my tablet. That held a charge all week and I will be getting another one of those.",71,2.0,2021,02,February,08
Best MOUSE ever,3,"Love this new mouse! I work from home for my job still and use my mouse all day everyday. I was originally using a big bulky gaming mouse ( it lights up and looked cool) for the last 2 years, but now my hand is starting to hurt and was ready to downgrade to something smaller and lighter. I saw this and had to see what it was about. Let me tell you I LOVE this new mouse. Its so small and light and easy to use. The clicks are super quiet and feels so great in the hand. Yes it is plastic but it actually doesn't feel cheap and feels like a good build. It's very responsive and glides very smooth. The only gripe is to wake of up from Sleep you have to click the mouse button, instead of just moving it like most items, but that's a very minor issue. Oh, and the different colors it comes In is nice. Also, the RGB color changing lighting is a very nice effect. I definitely recommend this mouse for home or office use.",184,5.0,2021,02,February,08

Colorful and left-hand friendly,4,"I’ve had this mouse since August 2021 and I don’t like writing reviews until I’ve had the item for a bit. This mouse worked great and I love how quiet it is, however about 4 weeks ago it started giving me trouble. I find myself tapping it with medium force on the desk in order for the cursor to move. I charge it completely and even completely charged, it gives me these issues.",73,5.0,2021,02,February,06

Worked well at first but now the buttons are wonky,10,"Could use an instruction sheet.  Also, what is the expected battery life on a single charge.”?",16,2.0,2021,01,January,13
Love the charging,3,Not having to change the battery is what drew me to this but it goes to sleep to save power and is hard to get it working again. I thought the slim profile mouse would be ok and better for travel but it is too hard to hold. I thought it might just be my big hands and gave it to my wife. She gave it back and said it was hard for her to hold on too.,78,5.0,2021,02,February,05

Love it,2,This is a nice size mouse and I love the color and lights. You have to charge it overnight if you use it all day like I do for work.,30,5.0,2021,02,February,05
Quite happy,2,Love this but it looses its juice within 8 hours without it being plugged in. I work a 12 hour shift so I have to plug it in during a very busy shift so I need one with a battery,40,5.0,2021,02,February,04
New Mouse,2,"Absolute garbage!!! Day 2 of using. If you have it on the multicolor setting the mouse will not work. I should have known something was up when the instructions were only in mandarin. It went straight to the trash can after i couldn’t get it to work. It also feels super cheap. Please if you’re reading these reviews, we’re not lying. DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE!",66,1.0,2021,02,February,04
Mouse just stopped working all together,6,I love how smooth and easy it is to handle. I just can't change the setting from all red to multicolor to the color I want : Purple.  So I mean I wait for Purple to come around and in happy with it. It does what I need. NEEDS BETTER DETAIL INSTRUCTIONS,52,1.0,2021,02,February,04
Love this device.... highly recommend !!!,6,This mouse is great as an everyday tool because of its ergonomics and functionability.,14,5.0,2021,02,February,04
Only worked for 1 month,5,"This was a nice mouse, I wouldn't recommend for children as it broke when dropped on floor. Adult use seems like it would be fine.",25,1.0,2021,02,February,03
Beware metal casing stuck inside your USB port,8,Love everything about it. I recommend it.,7,3.0,2021,02,February,03
Not impressed so far,4,"I love the way the mouse looks and feels, but oh the mistakes I make! This mouse has a mind of it's own and jumps all over the place. I have accidentally closed files/programs while working on them, move public folder (and having to contact IT to move back), and many more random errors as a result of this erratic mouse. Sometimes, while not even using the mouse - I can see the curser go on walkabout all over my screen. Perhaps there is a ghost in the machine, but if so, they are hostile... I will be replacing it ASAP!",101,3.0,2021,02,February,03
Good buy,2," I wish I would have seen the video from another reviewer with the white mouse before I purchased the white one.I don't like the fact that the light is visible throughout the whole mouse. I assumed it would just be a line of light that circles the mouse as shown in the sellers pictures. If you like the look of the whole mouse lighting up as shown in the video then this is the mouse for you.Overall, I do like the mouse and don't want to deal with exchanging. I planned on getting the mint and I should have gone with my instincts. It glides smoothly and the clicks are slient. I won't be returning it because I do like it but just diappointed the white one was not as shown/described",131,5.0,2021,02,February,03
Nice,1,Loved it... until it stopped working and wouldn’t charge in a couple months... now just junk.,16,4.0,2021,02,February,02

Great price for a great mouse for everyday use,9,I have been using for about 6 weeks and it died. It will not charge.,15,5.0,2021,02,February,02
So smooth,2,"A rechargeable cordless mouse is such a good idea and invention. You don't have to deal with batteries.  And this mouse seemed not to need recharging for over a day.. Great!!This one I bought worked well even though it did something odd,  (and I am not sure if it was the mouse or the ""inexpensive"" tablet computers that I use,  or maybe the USB splitters that I use, however it was probably the mouse ) but  after using the mouse normally for a few hours,  the mouse  would then  not show the arrow on the screen and I found that I would have to turn off the swatch on the mouse and then turn it back on again. It was  as if  I had to re-boot the mouse periodically.  It seemed to have  nothing to do with recharging. This would happen even after the mouse had been fully recharged.  It would be unpredictable as to when it would happen but overall even that was  a minor flaw.But then one day, ( actually the date of this writing March 16 2021)  I put the mouse receiver into a different receptacle to use a different tablet computer  and it would not work no matter what I tried to do.  Then I decided to take out the receiver from the USB receptacle  and found that the metal, square part on the receiver stuck into the USB receptacle.  So this leads me to believe that possibly the mouse receiver  became faulty with regular use over  a few weeks  since I bought it.  Otherwise the way that the receiver was made was not in the best possible way. Not rugged enough maybe.However though I don't know  at this point  if this is the way that  ALL these rechargeable mouses are  (this brand)  or if this particular one that I bought  just did not actually pass quality control at the factory,  it seems the company should give me a replacement.I am going to see about it but I guess  I will be told that the deadline for returns had been reached.I will update if I am able to.",352,5.0,2021,02,February,02
Not so great,3,The wife loves it. we use it for the camera system,11,1.0,2021,02,February,02
Great Product,2,"This mouse is great, and if it didn't do this one annoying thing I would give it 5 stars. It emits a really high pitched squeal when you don't use a mousepad. It coincides with the LED light color change, if you pick it up and set it down, it makes a really high frequency sound that is very irritating if you work in a quiet environment, which I do. It's similar to a smoke alarm if it were far away. Get one that doesn't have the lights, that should help.",91,5.0,2021,02,February,02
works only if not covered up by desk,8,"The only thing I do not like is having to charge it with a usb.  Sometimes I’m trying to use it and it’s dead, so I connect to computer and I can use it.  Works best with longer cord that I don’t have.",43,4.0,2021,02,February,01

Easy to use,3,"I HAD THE MOUSE CHARGING ALL WEEKEND. WHEN I RETURNED TO WORK MONDAY MORNING, I SMELLED SOMETHING HOT, BUT NO ONE ELSE SMELLED ANYTHING. I WENT TO UNPLUG MY MOUSE AND MY CORD WAS SO HOT I COULDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT. THE ENTIRE CORD MELTED AND THE WIRES HAD BURNED THROUGH THE RUBBER COATING.

Very quiet!,2,I thought this mouse was gonna work really good and  last a long time based on the reviews. Unfortunately the charger that came with the mouse isn't charging the mouse.

Almost perfect,2,"Simply put, it is a great mouse for what it's worth. However, I had difficulty connecting the mouse to my macbook pro with the USB c adapter that comes with the product. I have 4 ports. The manual (grammar is terrible btw) tells you to try different ports which they claim it will work normally in one of them.. NONE OF THEM WORKED which was a bummer.. then I tried with my own adapter and it connected it right away! The adapter they provide you is just useless. So if you plan on getting this mouse to use with your macbook, you should get a separate adapter. Once I connected it though, it seemed to work perfectly..smooth tracking, silent clicks and the RGB lighting is beautiful. I just got it today so hopefully, it will keep working the way they claim it should work.",144,3.0,2021,01,January,30

DISAPOINTED,1,"Just go to your local department store. When I opened the package and inspected the mouse, it had obvious scratches and looked like there was some wear on the bottom.

When looking for a mouse, I wanted something sleek and able to take with me to school and back. It fits my hand perfectly and I enjoy how sleek it looks.

Beautiful,1,I love this mouse but hate it at the same time. I love it because it’s cute and it functions well.....that is if it doesn’t run out of battery charge. During normal use the charge only lasts for about 3 days. It’s good that it can be recharged I just didn’t think I would be recharging it that often. You can tell when it’s running low because it starts jumping all over the place. I just try to remember to charge it while I’m charging my laptop. Also I was under the impression that it came as a usbc to charge and it does not. It comes with an adapter for usb to usbc. I could’ve just got an adapter for my old mouse had it been made clear.,129,5.0,2021,01,January,28

Awesome little mouse!,3,"Sensor doesn’t always pick up movements. To clarify, I am not using this f gaming but as a wireless mouse for work and coaching speech and debate. Sometimes when I sit for too long, the sensor takes time to come back online Andreas movements. This can be super frustrating when you are working and you need to move with alacrity but such is the life that one would expect from a $13 mouse.Overall, I’d you are doing menial office tasks, this is probably an okay mouse. The rechargeable batter is cool and I am happy to not have to replace batteries but I would probably go with a wired mouse in the future.",113,4.0,2021,01,January,27
Great little mouse!,3,"Nice, the only problem I've noticed so far is it's really hard to click the scroll (middle button). It's just really stiff.",22,5.0,2021,01,January,27
Great wireless mouse,3,Works great and battery lasts a long time! I’ve used it everyday since i purchased it a month or so ago and havent had to charge it many times. Clicks are very quiet as well and the light setting looks amazing,41,5.0,2021,01,January,27

Love this mouse!,3,It work super great. i recommend for other to buy,10,5.0,2021,01,January,27
Junk,1,"The click isn't loud but it does get picked up by my gaming computer recorder. The battery doesn't last near long enough, not even a whole day, even when you don't have the lights on. It does feel nice in the hand, it does track well but I would say a mouse pad isn't optional with this one.",58,1.0,2021,01,January,27

Best Mouse I’ve ever used!!,5,"I'm not a mouse person, I prefer the track pad but need it for work. Absolutely love it, even use it on my personal computer",25,5.0,2021,01,January,25
perfect product,2,I never write reviews. As a matter of fact this is the first I have ever written but due to the danger factor I felt compelled to.My son plugged in his mouse this morning and walked away and within a minute my husband smelled something burning and fortunately was able to get to it before the flames- yes flames reached the drapes because the charging cable caught on fire.,69,5.0,2021,01,January,25
"Just cycles colors, can’t choose. Works well though",8,Works well,2,4.0,2021,01,January,25
Right click button inoperative,4,I got this mouse for my daughter and she was beyond excited when we finally received it. Well day 1 it wouldn’t charge. So i gave it a break and decided to try charging it on my Mac (she had originally tried w/ her school chrome book). Few seconds of it being plugged in & it started SMOKING. It smelled like burning plastic so I quickly just unplugged and didn’t bother doing anything else with the mouse.,77,1.0,2021,01,January,25
It's pretty,2,"Great mouse for travel as it is very slim and ergonomic. Perfect for the bag that has just enough space. When you’re on the go and you need to pack up and move quickly, it’s sleep mode feature is a nice adage, increasing battery life and usability. As far as gaming goes, I would recommend only lite/casual games only, not for gaming on the heavy side. Overall 9/10 would buy again",71,5.0,2021,01,January,25

"Very good mouse, excellent",4,love this mouse havent had to charge it at all since i got it amazing,15,5.0,2021,01,January,08
Really Nice Product,3,"I like this mouse.  The light colors constantly scroll through a rainbow and aren't static on just one color.  My office is in my bedroom, and if I leave the mouse on, it makes a great nightlight -- not too bright, but just light enough to find my way around if I wake up during the night.  I especially love the fact that it's rechargeable and that I haven't had to put any batteries in it since I bought it several months ago.The thing I don't like is that it has a tendency to do its own thing sometimes.  If I'm working on the couch and put the mouse down next to me (flat and completely still, not rolling backwards or moving at all) the cursor on the screen will sometimes take off at a diagonal, stuttering its way up and across the screen.  At other times, I will be using the mouse to click and drag something or draw a line and the cursor will suddenly jump to a completely different part of the screen, or it will ""hiccup"" and lose the hold on what I was clicking and dragging or cause the line to wobble (sometimes quite sharply, kind of like trying to draw a straight line in the car when the tire hits a pothole).It's a good little mouse, and aside from the spastic glitches, I'm pleased with it, but I am getting tired of not having full control right when I need it most.  I may keep this one for its nightlight capabilities and shop for another rechargeable mouse to use with my computer.",268,5.0,2021,01,January,21
Didn't Charge,2,It does not work and I have tried to reach the seller. Instructions in chinese and simply poor poor service. Purchase at own peril. great disappointment for my kid.,29,1.0,2021,01,January,21
It’s okay,2,"it was going well for a few weeks then, my son dropped his MacBook and the usb type-c connected BROKE! its so easy to break and I would not recommend",30,2.0,2021,01,January,21
Don't bother with this mouse! Does NOT last!,8,"My daughter needed a wireless mouse for her laptop. I came across this one and bought it for it's cool features, size, and price. It is so smooth and she loves using it along with that fact that it lights up; goes with her LED lights in her room. You won't be disappointed with this mouse.",56,2.0,2021,01,January,21
Unbelievably bad,2,"I really like how sleek this mouse is, it extremely functional and the lights add a cool “futuristic” type of vibe making my experience enjoyable every time. Another neat function is the silent clicker, I work early mornings so to not wake up my family with the constant clicking of a noisy mouse is definitely a luxury. I’m happy with my purchase.",62,1.0,2021,01,January,21

Great Looking And Feeling Mouse,5,I purchased the rose gold and it matches my Airbook 13. Charges fast and lasts a long time between charges. Glad I bought this wireless mouse. I use it for 8 hrs a day 5 days a week.,38,5.0,2021,01,January,20
Colorful,1,"The mouse is a colorful addition to my desk and, unlike other computer mice I have owned, it does NOT have thumb-operated controls on its left side, where a left-handed person like myself would unintentionally press a button and start a function they didn't want to activate.  I've only had it for about a week, so it remains to be seen how frequently it needs to be recharged; the light display draws a significant amount of power, so I need to remember to turn the mouse off whenever I shut down the PC.",93,5.0,2021,01,January,20
Squeaky Mouse,2,Love it,2,3.0,2021,01,January,20
Warning this product may have been tampered with,8," The black feels super soft. I just plugged it into my USB-C on my computer. It also comes with a USB adapter Incase you don’t have that. Left and right button clicks softy not annoyingly. Middle scroll works great, the click is a bit louder and it won’t click onto a document so that click that doesn’t do anything. Happy with this purchase, it looks great at night and it’s such a gamer / music producer look.",77,1.0,2021,01,January,20
Great Customer Service From Shop Over Unique Product,8,"great mouse for price, thought it was bluetooth, but its not. still good though",14,5.0,2021,01,January,20
Great mouse,2,It is sleek and I like the fact that I can charge it on my computer. It does light up and it works great. After sitting for a while the mouse needs to wake up by pressing the right click.,40,5.0,2021,01,January,19

Great slim and minimalist design for a mouse,8,Purchased as a gift for my nephew. He really likes it.,11,5.0,2021,01,January,19
No english,2,"3 month update: This thing squeals now! It took me a week to figure out why I kept hearing a high pitched whine every time I moved my cursor, and eventually I realized that something inside the mouse is creating a very high pitched squeal every time I move it -- that, on top of the mouse dying in about a day of use now, means that this thing is a no-go. Definitely buy something else, this thing has been a total headache since I got it.The battery on this mouse doesn't seem to last a very long time, after about two days of usage it'll die. I find myself plugging it in every night to make sure I don't have to deal with that.Additionally, the thing goes to sleep after about a minute or two without movement -- super annoying, you have to click the mouse to wake it up again, and doing so registers a click wherever your mouse was left on screen before it went to sleep. Can't recommend it for any type of work that requires small periods of typing or reading, you'll end up waking up the mouse from its weird sleep about a million times.",201,5.0,2021,01,January,19
Type c port does not work,6,My mouse decided to stop working and forced me to have to get a new one. I found this one and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad that I did. It's sleek and stylish and I love that it lights up. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a sleek and fun mouse.,60,1.0,2021,01,January,19

Rechargeable mouse,2,The metal casing for the USB remote came  off and is now stuck  in the USB port of my computer,20,5.0,2021,01,January,18
Love the lights.,3,"First, the left mouse click is not sensitive enough, requiring a longer press than usual for the mouse to register the click. Annoying, and I'm betting it will shorten the life of the mouse because you have to press harder/longer. Another less significant annoyance: make sure you don't turn on the light feature. It looks cool, but the thing acts like a lava light night light, continually changing colors of light even when not in use (even with the computer off), which will run down the battery. I like the rechargeable feature, but I will be looking for another mouse.",100,5.0,2021,01,January,18
SO quiet!,2,The mouse is sleek and comfortable. I enjoy the sleep mode because I am terrible about turning off my mouse when I'm not using. Setup is simple since it has an adapter.,32,5.0,2021,01,January,18
Awesome,1,Got it for my wife she seems to like it it looks nice and feels good in hand.,18,5.0,2021,01,January,18
Broke 1st day !!!,4,"I love this mouse , I've had others before  but never like this , it was so easy to connect,  just  plug in the USB connector and thats it , no drivers to install  or to download  , works  right out the box .. its so natural  when using  this mouse  , I even used it when I was in the coach and it worked perfectly on the arm rest , I would  recommend this all day , good product..",80,1.0,2021,01,January,17
Best Mouse Ever!,3, I was in the market for a new mouse as my Logitech wireless was going bad on me. I was red to stay wireless and had a budget. The Logitech and other named brands were just too expensive when I wanted one that looked cool. And the cheaper ones were too normal looking. I got this one as it was cheap and the led lights were a cool feature. I got it and it feels great. It feels like an apple mouse and the buttons were really quiet and didn’t have the typical mouse click sound.Edit: I had to get a other mouse as my first broke. It was completely my fault as it had fell and was stepped on by accident. Since it was so cheap I just bought another and it works as well as the first.,139,5.0,2021,01,January,17

UPDATE,1,"The mouse only works if directly next to the usb port it is plugged into, so it is useless if using it a foot below (on a keyboard tray).  The instructions are not in english to try and troubleshoot.",39,4.0,2021,01,January,16
Easy setup and works great,5,"Love it. It fits my hand, just right. Only issue is that it came in another language..",17,5.0,2021,01,January,16

To pretty much be stealth in school,7,Everything went smoothly! The mouse looks awesome and works perfect!,10,5.0,2021,01,January,16
it's such a eye catcher.,5,"Decent while it worked ( though waking from sleep required switching it off & back on underneath ). The laser stopped working ( fully charged up ), only color lights work, making it useless.",34,5.0,2021,01,January,16
Daughter loves it,3,This mouse is perfect!I bought it to match with my keynote light up keyboard and it matches better than I expected. The colors change while gaming just as my keyboard does and it works perfectly for gaming and normal day-to-day use.Would buy again.,43,5.0,2021,01,January,15
The most quiet wireless mouse,5,This mouse worked one time and hasn't worked since. I have tried charging it and flipping it to different settings. It lights up and that is all that it does.,30,5.0,2021,01,January,15
"slim wireless mouse, rosetone",4,"I'm not rating this one star because it is a cute mouse and I like the design. For some reason, I found my MacBook trackpad more comfortable to use than this mouse. My wrists were hurt within a couple hours of using this mouse. That being said, I used it in moderation. I wanted to like it. However, I received this mouse January 4th. As of January 31, responsiveness has gone downhill. After taking it off the charger (it has a short battery life), it takes about 30 seconds and moving the scroll wheel for it to respond again. Even then, it might have some hard to ignore hiccups.",109,1.0,2021,01,January,15
It’s ok,2,i have one and my grandson liked it so i got him one for his birthday,16,5.0,2021,01,January,15
I guess you get what you pay for.,8,"For $10, you are better off getting a wired mouse. This thing is so bad, the sensor light bleeds through the top  shell of the mouse. Worse is that the actual functionality is very poor, if your are looking for an accurate mouse, this is not it. I have a multi colored mouse pad and the sensor struggles between the change in shades making this mouse difficult to use. If you have a plain color mouse pad this may be acceptable, but if your on the go, this will not do.",91,2.0,2021,01,January,15
"This mouse is okay, bordering on pretty good",8,"Highly recommend, silent click is great. You have the option to turn off the color changing mode.",17,4.0,2021,01,January,15

Great gaming mouse!,3,"Easy to setup, just plug in the USB and it works. Smooth cursor movement and clicking, but the wheel does not scroll very well. Only moves the screen a few lines and then it quits scrolling all together.",38,5.0,2021,01,January,14
Nice Mouse; as advertised.,4,"Great so far, I use it for my MacBook Pro and I'm really enjoying it. Great touch and super lightweight.",20,5.0,2021,01,January,14

Disappointed,1,Great mouse,2,2.0,2021,01,January,13
I thought it was American made,6,"I really enjoy the feel of the mouse, it's slick which has put less strain on my wrist but I'll still be getting a wrist support. The colors don't need to be turned on and when left in middle, it keeps the mouse on with only the red light from underneath.",51,3.0,2021,01,January,13
Not as advertised,3,I love the color and the light the most. It’s so easy to use and the best part is not having to download drivers.,24,2.0,2021,01,January,13
Had to return,3,"I am old school when it comes to navigating the screen.  I work much faster with a wireless mouse.  Everything about this mouse is great EXCEPT you gotta to charge it.  Mouse that require batteries work for a very long time. Months in fact.  The charge on this mouse doesn't last long.  I have to remember to turn it off when I'm not using it.  I also have to remember to plug it into charge after long use.  Starts acting sluggish as power runs down.  My old mouse is 15 years old.  I wanted a cool new one to match my new laptop.  This one has a soft smooth click.  The LED lights are really fun.  However, I threw away the box before I tried it out.  I would send it back if I had kept shipping material.  I'll just keep the old one close when the new one is charging.  So much for progress.i",155,1.0,2021,01,January,13
Good buy,2,I made sure that this product was gonna be a good one and i was not disapointed. It's silent click which is nice. The lights look awesome on it. It was just worth it.,34,5.0,2021,01,January,13

Great Comfortable Mouse,3,"UPDATE: I have upped my review from 2 to 3 since I reached out to the seller and they offered to send a replacement USB dongle. Will update the review again once that has been received. **I would have given this mouse five stars a month ago, but yesterday when I removed the USB dongle from my laptop the thing fell apart in my hands and the mouse is now worthless. I tried to piece it back together but it won't stay together. It's a shame because this mouse is really cool looking, feels nice in my hand, and holds a charge a long time. Very disappointed!",107,5.0,2021,01,January,12

Installation instructions are confusing.,4,Goes through batteries like water,5,3.0,2021,01,January,09
"Wish this mouse kept the charge, SO SAD . . .",11,"Is almost tiny for my hands and very light. Works so good and decently priced I'll learn to use it for surfing the web. Yet let me mention it seems the curve under shape is fine for my thumb side, but the pinky finger side is going to take some getting used to. Many times my pinky then fingers slide right under it or lift it off the surface slightly no matter how gentle I think I'm holding it.  In the past I've had taller models that have a flair formed to keep the fingers in position. In construction using stuff that requires a good grip, makes this like using a feather I barely feel. Makes me wonder how it would be for gaming if you got excitement and need to make a lot fast moves. Elves would love this thing though and it scrolls and moves around so good, I may even make a flange for my fingers and to give it some weight without an old fashioned battery weighing it down. It is cool with the lights no joke,  a good choice since many look just like this and perhaps everybody else has more grip control, lol, yet thank you, I found another fun product on Amazon again.",210,1.0,2021,01,January,09
Wheel button unusable. Mouse not fit for work requiring it.,10,"I purchased this mouse for my chromebook which only has a mousepad. I enjoy that it really lights up.

Love it!,2,Wish you could select the color of the rgb light. It just cycles through all of them. Nothing in the instructions so it must only cycle. Besides that it’s nice. Super quiet click. Clicking the scroll wheel is loud and hard though.,42,5.0,2021,01,January,08

Awesome Mouse,2, Although it's pretty it works great and I love the colors I got it for asthetics but it's very functional I work at home 8 hours a day and the charge is lasting quite long.,35,5.0,2021,01,January,07
IT sucks,2,"I have many wireless mouses (mice?) trying to find the right one for my home office/studio.  I bought this one for the slim design in the matte black finish.  It arrived and I have never used a mouse that's this quiet before, it's insane.  It feels great when I use it, it's smooth and very ergonomic.  This was definitely worth the price, and I may replace my other wireless devices with this model!",73,1.0,2021,01,January,07
Ahhh silence,2,Best mouse I’ve ever bought so glad I got it perfect for my job.,14,5.0,2021,01,January,07
I love that it is a quiet mouse no click noise.,11,The top is not opaque like the photos. It's translucent. There is only one lighting mode. There is no rainbow effect on the edge like the photo.,27,5.0,2021,01,January,06
One fun mouse,3,It's cheap. My right click requires more Force than my left. The LEDs aren't that vibrant. Not ergonomic. It's a decent mouse but I wouldn't recommend it for gaming.,29,4.0,2021,01,January,05
not brand new!,3,"The calibration on this is terrible. I can’t even use it. It goes all over the place, doesn’t go where im directing it to go. I make calls for work on my computer and it’s hung up when I was clearly going to the opposite side of the screen. It’s terrible.",51,3.0,2021,01,January,05
Great Product for the Price,5,The battery life on it is crap. You have to recharge it every few hours. It’s not worth the hassle. When it’s charged it also has some pretty bad lag or just doesn’t move the cursor the way you move the mouse.,42,5.0,2021,01,January,05
Rechargeable,1,Granddaughter likes the lights,4,5.0,2021,01,January,05
Amazing,1,you get about 8 hours use time on this and then you have to charge it up separately. Not worth the trouble.,22,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Mouse works very well for eveything. I bought two because of price,12,"The mouse lasts a good while on a charge, as it shuts itself off.A good product.",16,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Cheap and reliable,3,"Stopped working after a few days of use on a brand new laptop. Will turn on, but does not function properly/lags.However great the first few days.",26,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Great wireless mouse,3,"It doesn't have a tail, so it's more of a hamster, but it is a very nice hamster! It lights up really nicely and it is very accurate control of the cursor. I can't speak on it for gaming as I only use it for working from home, but I did like it enough to buy one for my work desk as well. Obviously, 10/10, did indeed by it again!",70,5.0,2021,01,January,04
Great wireless mouse,3, Small. Lightweight. Charged pretty fast and lasted quite a while. Perfect for what we need! I recommend!,17,5.0,2021,01,January,04

Great,1,Don’t bother doesn’t work,4,5.0,2021,01,January,02
"Battery saver, which makes it last long.",7,So I really like it. I like you can shut of the lights if you want.  It is sensitive so your mouse moves very easily and it's very easy for a person who has a laptop.,36,5.0,2021,01,January,01
My New Favorite Mouse!,4,"I use this mouse for work and it holds up for 8 hrs. It doesn’t take long to charge, and the changing colors is a plus! Glad I purchased",29,5.0,2021,01,January,01
Nice slim mouse for the hand,6,"This is a great little mouse. It is small, responsive and I love the way the light changes colors. My hand is more relaxed when I'm using it than with my previous mouse. I have had no issues with it so far. Overall, based upon my experience thus far, this was a good purchase and I would buy it again.",60,5.0,2021,01,January,01
Fantastic,1,"I only used it once until it was dead and then I charged for hours, it wouldn't even turn on. So in all the charging feature does not work. :( It was a cute mouse though, but it doesn't work.",40,5.0,2021,01,January,01
slim wireless mouse,3,"I did not like that it made a very faint squealing noise. The colors are pretty and the clicks are quiet. But everytime the mouse moves, you can hair a high pitch noise. The instructions were all in a foreign language as well",43,5.0,2020,12,December,31
Great mouse for everyday use,5," UPDATE to prior review: This mouse started out great, was so excited about it at first. Then after a couple months in, all of the sudden, the usb that goes into the computer just snaps/breaks. And, I'll add I did nothing to it. One day while working from home I moved the laptop to start work and noticed the mouse wasn't functioning. I looked to see why, then saw the usb had just cratered into a couple pieces. So now I paid $16 for nothing! Good Lord my own money too, not something my office will reimburse me for either. Nice work.",102,5.0,2020,12,December,31
Good price,2,"Clicking this mouse takes so much force I have to physically move my arm to get the leverage to do it. And if I ever pick the mouse up off the pad, my cursor moves erratically around, even if it's pointed at the ceiling.Literally the 2 most important things for a mouse: pointing and clicking, are useless on this thing.Looks nice, though.",62,4.0,2020,12,December,31
Great mouse for the price.,5,"On my laptop, it skips/doesn’t read about 10% of the time, making it unusable for gaming or pretty much anything that requires quick response time. I tried it on several types of mouse pads and surfaces, and it does the same no matter what.",44,5.0,2020,12,December,31
Sleek Mouse,2,"VERY DISAPPOINTED I RECEVIED THIS ITEM DECEMBER 27TH , I UNOXED IT ON DECEMBER 30TH. TODAY IS JAN 20TH AND THE MOUSE STOP WORKING .",25,5.0,2020,12,December,31
Tracking,1,"Not a fan. Wouldn’t sync with one computer. Worked great with the other computer, but it didn’t “sleep” when I was done with it. So the next day, the battery was dead. I’ll never remember to turn off the mouse when I’m not using it, so this is not going to be very useful.",54,1.0,2020,12,December,30
Super cute!,2,"Works great, just feels a little flimsy so I'm not sure how it will hold up.  I suppose it's a good value for the price.  The slowly changing colored LED lights are pretty cool.  I like that, unlike the Apple Magic Mouse, you can use this mouse while it is charging. The seller extended the warranty another 6 months after I registered it, so that gives me a little more confidence in the quality (or at least the customer service).I was compensated by the seller for this review with a refund of the purchase price of the mouse.",98,5.0,2020,12,December,30
Not multi colored,3,The Mouse Is AMAZING You Can Pick Out Diff Colors And i LOVE How It Glows Rainbow Greatest Purchase Ever!!,20,2.0,2020,12,December,30
Comfortable mouse,2,Love it and the colors❣️,5,5.0,2020,12,December,30
Very nice mouse!,3,"Really like array of colors so I purchased mouse for every day workflow not gaming. The scroll wheel is a bit squeaky, that’s the only flaw. Not sure if I will keep it or put in ‘file 13’.",38,5.0,2020,12,December,29
"Read if you want, beats me",6,"No stars will be given, this item holds no charge and interferes with the rest of my computer. This item is not useable it trusted",25,3.0,2020,12,December,29
Love these!,2,"I originally ordered the white version but when I got it, I realized it was see-through. I asked the shop owner whether this was just an issue with the version I ordered or what all the white mouses look like. They’re all white, according to the shop. Because I raised concern, they were so kind to ship a different color to me free of charge. I didn’t even have to return the original!",73,5.0,2020,12,December,29
Great quality! Vibrant colors!,4,This mouse works excellent. It’s easy to move. Very lightweight. I love the way it lights up. Excellent buy.,19,5.0,2020,12,December,28
Very very thin,3,It works great. Fits my hand great. Only thing is the lights don’t work at efficiently. Happy with the product overall.,21,4.0,2020,12,December,27
Must buy,2,If you need a mouse just for making your life easier while working with spread sheets or any other microsoft office tool this is perfect. I'm not quite sure how comfortable this would be for gaming though.,37,5.0,2020,12,December,27
Changing colors and quite,4,No instructions in English. Sleep mode??? No ideaWorks fine and the color changing is cute,15,5.0,2020,12,December,26
Update: Customer service contacted me and they will send me a new product.,13,"Using the type c port as its plug-in method does not work. While plugged in, my computer does not detect or accept the plug-in. If this is your main use in mind, do not use it.",36,4.0,2020,12,December,26
Love the color changing,4,I really liked everything about this product!!,7,5.0,2020,12,December,25
Fits nicely,2,it's easy to use and works well there is no loud clicking when using it. to get it to change colors you must push the on button all the way up to the top. and it changes color when you touch it which I find pretty cool,47,5.0,2020,12,December,25
Lights up nice,3,This came with an c3 charging attachment but why? This uses a normal cell phone charger port. And all the intuitions are in Chinese. Theres a random button at the top and when I press it Nothing happens. And I dont know how to tell how much charge there is on it. Other than that I really like it so far. Its very sleek.,64,5.0,2020,12,December,24
Buy it,2,This mouse is very sleek and comfortable to use. The click is very quiet. I highly recommend for the price!,20,5.0,2020,12,December,22
👍,1,The LED lights are pretty but otherwise this mouse is not responding well and overall does not handle too well. I am disappointed and would not buy it again.,29,5.0,2020,12,December,22
I love this mouse,4,"I was skeptical at first that such a small ergonomic mouse would work, I’m pleasantly surprised and have really enjoyed using it. I forgot to recharge it but it lets you know before it goes out by slowing down or moving from one screen to my other. I got it plugged in immediately and it kept right on working while it charged. I highly recommend this Mouse and plan on buying another to have as a backup for when I forget to charge. I really love the color changing sequence the colors are bright but not overly so just enough to make it fun.",104,5.0,2020,12,December,22
Not worth the money,4,I use this with my macbook pro and its a good eye catcher when I'm djing.,16,1.0,2020,12,December,22
No complaints here!,3,"This mouse is very quiet, just as advertised.  I was shocked at the lack of ""clicking"" when you push the right or left side.  That was my main push to purchase, besides the cool colors and LED lights.  I must say those are just an aestetic  bonus, but it kind of makes working fun.  This mouse is plastic, so the ""gold"" tone you see is gold plastic and the underbelly is white plastic.  It charges fast and it responds just as quickly as my older battery powered wireless mouse.  Overall, this mouse is really great.  I am glad I bought it and if you are sitting on the fence, just go ahead and get it.",115,5.0,2020,12,December,21
Not user-friendly. I wouldn't recommend it,6,Really great for the mouse really light and wow just passed my expectations would buy again.,16,2.0,2020,12,December,21
Great,1,USB got stuck and broke inside my computer,8,5.0,2020,12,December,21
Do not purchase,3,The mouse was shipped fast and the packaging was in good condition. The pairing was fast and easy. I spent $100.00 on a razer mouse with the same functions and lighting it broke in six months! I'm very happy with my purchase.,42,1.0,2020,12,December,20
Works good with my MacBook.,5,Love this: it feels like an extension of my hand!,10,5.0,2020,12,December,19
Smooth!!,1,This broke after 1 day.,5,5.0,2020,12,December,18
A good mouse,3,Works great! And looks classy!,5,4.0,2020,12,December,18
Good product,2,"It's cute I guess. It is pretty cheaply made. You can just tell by the feel of it. I got the matte black one. It charges pretty fast and lasts for hours on one charge. I love the nano USB plug. It came with a cord, but I just use my phone charger. It does change colors and also has the option of turning the colors off with the little button on the bottom. The instructions are all in Chinese, but using it is pretty easy. The nano fits in a little spot under the mouse for storage and also comes with an adapter. It is quite flat, so not the best for long term use like with gaming. I'll keep it, but wouldn't purchase it again for the price.Update:I have used this cheap little mouse for HOURS every night since I got it. I've only had to charge it maybe once a week. The charge is phenomenal. Still works perfectly!!",161,4.0,2020,12,December,18
Very cheap made and flimsy,5,"I wanted a wireless mouse and this one fit my needs. It is rechargeable and can be turned off which helps save battery power. It can also be used while the charging cable is plugged in if necessary. The colors are a great touch and I use them depending on the mood I'm in at the time.  I also like being able to choose the resolution ""on the fly"" with the button on the top. I have already recommended it to a couple of friends.",85,3.0,2020,12,December,17
Pretty Great for non-gaming use,5,The mouse looks nice HOWEVER the instructions are in Chinese.I struggled with connecting but once I figured it out its working awesome so far. I will do an update in a few months.So far so good!!,36,5.0,2020,12,December,17

Cursor jumps around,3,Great product for the price...my daughter loves it! It is so quiet when you're clicking the buttons that you can hear it at all so I have decided to purchase myself one as well!,34,2.0,2020,12,December,15
Not happy.,2,"This mouse is amazing. I work in IT and have been working from home for quite some time. There are days where I have to work 10-12 hours. My hand does not get tired at all when using this mouse for long periods of time. It is super easy to setup...just connect to the USB and you’re done. The BEST part that I love about this mouse is that it is superrrrrrrrrr quiet! The weeks that I’m on-call, I do not have to feel discouraged and walking on eggshells when I have to respond to an urgent matter in the middle of the night and having to risk waking up my partner with the continuous mouse clicking sound. I will definitely buy another one just in case if I lose it.",131,1.0,2020,12,December,15
Love love love!,3,"If you are looking for a mouse that is small and slim, pretty color and one that lights up, this one does all of that and it is quiet.While the little booklet is in a foreign languageI am satisfied with my purchase and even though the seller offered,  no refund is necessary.",52,5.0,2020,12,December,14
Led Wireless Mouse,3,Very cute but the cursor for the mouse didn’t work. All other buttons worked thou,15,2.0,2020,12,December,14
NOT for gaming,3,"Pros: matte feel, slim profile, quiet clickCons: instructions were in another language so there wasn't any information on how to set up (I guessed), came with a scratch on it, track wheel DOES NOT WORK!!",35,1.0,2020,12,December,13
Nice little mouse,3,"There's nothing majorly, egregiously wrong with this mouse but it doesn't necessarily excel at anything. The mouse is pretty light, the buttons are reasonably clicky and responsive. The sleep mode is a bit aggressive, and I find myself often annoyed with how quickly the mouse goes to sleep and I have to wait for it to reconnect before using it again.The DPI is by far the biggest problem, it doesn't feel like the DPI switch on the mouse actually does anything, and it almost feels like the DPI changes randomly while in use. I've noticed this behavior with a mouse mat, and on a flat desk alone. This may be just my unit but beware it nonetheless.Overall, it's definitely good enough for what I needed - a cheap, wireless, rechargeable mouse that is passable for office work, however I wouldn't use it for anything beyond that.",146,5.0,2020,12,December,13
"Works well, inexpensive",3,"Sweet sleek mouse with nice color, can't wait till its nighttime to show it off",15,5.0,2020,12,December,12

Nice but could be better,5,"The description says that it is C adapter for Macbook Air. This is NOT true. You have to plug C adapter into laptop and then the USB wireless tab into the adapter.

Awesome mouse!,2,"1) When I opened my mouse, I noticed there were scratches on the top of the mouse, towards the area where your palm would rest when in use. I also noticed that the adapter that arrived with the mouse did not fit the USB that would make the mouse compatible with my MacBook, so I had to use a different adapter. Considering I paid for a NEW $14 mouse, I was expecting to get better quality.2) Gave the mouse a second chance and this time I received one that didn't work.",91,5.0,2020,11,November,23

Review,1,Disliked,1,2.0,2020,11,November,18
Not for me,3,Started out and I loved this mouse butwithin 2 months it would not hold a charge for more tha a few hours.Annoying having to use it plugged in. I bought this for the convenience of only having to rechage every couple of days to this in unacceptable. If it was even once a day I could handle it since I like the mouse but can't stand charging every few hours. So sad.,72,3.0,2020,11,November,17
Do not buy - product doesn’t work,7,The wheel button feels like it requires 5x the force to activate and makes 10x the noise of the other 2 buttons. Whoever approved this should be fired straight into the sun. The wheel button gets more use in CAD software than any other button and not even 5 minutes of use and the wrist is already strained to the point where I can not continue to work.,68,1.0,2020,11,November,17
Nice for the price - Paint chips badly,8,"The good thing is this mouse is cheap, but it feels like it too.  The wheel is terrible and the buttons are not even or flush and when moving from the wheel to the buttons your finger catches on the button.  other than feeling really cheaply made it functions as it should",52,4.0,2020,11,November,17

good Keyboard,2,"works as advertised, has good action and the lights are fun.",11,5.0,2022,11,November,07
Buyer Beware!!!,2,I bought this as a gift so unfortunately it wasn’t opened until after the return window but it only worked for 1 day!!! LED background lights work 25% of the time and it will not charge. Save your time and money and do not buy this product!,47,1.0,2022,11,November,06
Literal definition of useless and stupid.,6,"Now, correct me if I'm wrong but a keyboard is meant to be used to type. I hooked this up to my rig and when I try to type anything literally nothing happens then like 40secs later the first letter of what I tried to type pops up, then nothing happens. If the description of this keyboard would've said ""light up keyboard for display use only"" then 5 out of 5 stars. Since it is advertised as a useful keyboard and a gaming keyboard at that I'd have to say don't buy it, buy literally anything else and maybe even 2 letters might get typed.",105,1.0,2022,11,November,05
Great keyboard!,2,This keyboard shipped quickly and is very easy to use. I love the colors in the backlighting. The customer service was also great. Highly recommend!,25,5.0,2022,11,November,04
Battery dies fast,3,"I use this keyboard with my gaming laptop - only when I'm not using my gaming desktop. The keyboard is quite nice and responsive, but the battery dies very fast. I use it maybe 30 mins a day, and it dies in a week. I would much rather have less backlighting and AA batteries I can swap out. I hate when it dies in the middle of a game and then I have to plug it in and wait while it charges.",82,2.0,2022,11,November,03
TOP TIER customer service + Great Product!,7,"I purchased this maybe 8-9 months ago, and it worked great. The battery life is really impressive, barely ever had to charge it and I am a pretty hardcore PC gamer. No noticeable latency, and it goes between sleep and active mode seamlessly. The full color RGB is a definite nice touch. Also, the keys have a nice soft press feel to them. Very quiet. If you are looking for a very pronounced mechanical keystroke, this is not that.Their customer service responds extremely fast, and was refreshing to have such helpful people respond to a message in the fashion they did. 10/10. Will order from again in the future.",109,5.0,2022,11,November,03
Excellent wireless,2,"I've had this wireless keyboard for almost a month. This is my first one, because my brother was the one that recommended this to me. I had get used to the backlit lights not being on all the time, but overall this is an excellent wireless keyboard, and I have not had an issue with it. It came undamaged. And it arrived quick. And the customer service at KLIM has excellent customer service.",73,5.0,2022,10,October,30
Adorable,1,"I got this because it was cute and I needed soft keys or my girlfriend was going to lose her mind when we work from home together. It’s soft , quiet. Cute and easy function. I love it. Does die faster than I would like but it lights up. Of course it does.",53,5.0,2022,10,October,29

Go for it!,3,"So I needed a good quality wireless keyboard, but I was a little unsure any would meet my standards as I'm a techie and have a huge TV and distance to my couch where I was going to play PC games from. Just WOW. This thing has the responsiveness of a wired gaming keyboard, feels great to handle, and I use it at nearly 15 feet away to boot. It's actually better than some of my professional keyboards I use at nearly 5x the cost. Totally worth the buy, and the battery lasts ridiculously long.",95,5.0,2022,10,October,23

Lousy,1,"I loved this keyboard when I first started using it..... But that didn't last very long. I haven't even been using this keyboard for a full month yet and it quit working completely. Such a waste of time, completely useless for working from home. The usb stays plugged in all the time so I can use the wireless capability, but it just quit charging, I can press 1 key and then it completely dies, even if I plug in the usb cord it will light up but no matter what key i press it does absolutely nothing. I am returning this ASAP. Don't waste your time or money. Garbage",109,1.0,2022,10,October,11

Fantastic product and excellent company,5,"I honestly love this product. The keys are very comfortable to use and the ergonomics of the keyboard are conducive for gaming and typing. My keyboard did experience some issues with the left side shift key after about 2 years of heavy use so I reached out to customer support and was mailed a replacement in about 2 days after contacting them. The customer support team is extremely friendly and helpful. Overall, this is an excellent product and excellent company. I will absolutely purchase any PC hardware from Klim in the future.",92,5.0,2022,10,October,06
Great Wireless Keyboard,3,"This is a great wireless keyboard and it's really quiet, which I'm sure over time and use, the loud clicking will return. (That's what my other gaming keyboard did anyway.)

No Workie.,2,Just lays there like a squash. Pretty colors when you press on the keys. But the keys don't work. Keyboard that doesn't type. Done trying to get this thing to work. Just a basic run-of-the-mill piece of crap that has pretty lights.,42,1.0,2022,10,October,04
Great and Colorful Keyboard,4,"I purchased this keyboard last year in November 2021 and have been very satisfied with it's performance. It is comfortable to type on and the different color backlighting is cool, but it would be better if the sleep mode didn't take effect so soon. This is an issue when in a dim room because it can be a bit difficult to see the opaque lettering before pressing on that first key to activate the lights.Additionally, recently the keyboard was only staying on if it was connected to the charging cable it came with, and last week, it began shutting off intermittently even while connected. That should have alerted me to the fact that it was a cable issue and not a battery issue, but it didn't and I contacted Klim's customer service. Lolita, the customer service agent, responded quickly and one of the suggestions given was to try a different cable. But she also reiterated that there was a 5-year warranty should none of the suggestions resolve the issue. Charging with a different cable that I already had in my possession worked and I am now utilizing the keyboard again without having to be connected.I am extremely happy with this product and their customer service and would not hesitate to order one of their other products should I need one in the future.",223,4.0,2022,10,October,04

Working like a champ,4,"The user was not expecting a rechargeable keyboard, and has been pleasantly surprised by this one. The bells and whistles haven't been a main draw [past the first day or two, fiddling with the colors]. Performance-wise, this keyboard has been standing up well to normal business use, and the recharge at night is not onerous - it's just one last thing to do before heading out for the day. No big deal.",72,5.0,2022,10,October,03
Extremely Loud Spacebar,3,I have purchased two of these keyboards and both have extremely loud spacebars.  I have tried greasing the key among other things and it does not resolve the issue.  Other than that I like the keyboard.,36,3.0,2022,10,October,01
"Colorful, wireless, compact... but placement of keys is a problem",10,"I love colorful keyboards even though I'm not a gamer. When I purchased this one, I was thrilled to see how colorful it was, how handy it was to just charge it up and not struggle with a cord and find it has a long battery life. However, I have had consistent trouble with the layout of the keys. The biggest problem I have is the Enter key. When I'm typing, I'm constantly getting the ""\"" instead of the enter key. I thought I would get used to it, but I haven't for over a couple of months. Other keys are a little bit off what I expect, so I'm frequently making typos when using apostrophes, etc. I plan to keep it in reserve, but I've ordered a Logitech keyboard because I'm quite sure the keys will be in the places I expect for touch typing.",146,3.0,2022,09,September,26

Works only 5 minutes,4,"I bought this keyboard. It worked great right out of the box for 5 minutes, then nothing. I thought maybe battery was dead. So I charged it for a while. It never turned on again. I thought, maybe it's the port, so I switched ports. Nothing. I thought maybe it's the driver, so I fixed that, still nothing. I thought it was the computer, so I funnily enough, bought a new one. It does not work. Nothing you do will make this work. This is a paper weight at most. Like, it feels nice to touch, it does nothing. It is just there to look nice. It is a mistake of a creation, and honestly, using the accessibility keyboard works better than this. I tested it. I went and played wow using accessibility keyboard, then I used this. Obviously, the accessibility keyboard was phenomenal in comparison, mainly because this one does not work. I would pay to not have this in my memory.",163,1.0,2022,09,September,14

Didn't even last 8 months. Don't waste your money.,9,"Charging indicator light stopped working after only a few days, so I could never tell if its actually charging or not....wasn't a huge deal because at least it still worked....BUT now that it's been like 8 months, I went to plug it in the other night, charged it all night, and it now wont even hold a charge. I can plug it in for hours, turn it on and the lights only stay on for a few seconds before the whole unit dies. Totally not happy that I now have to spend another $50-100 that I don't have on another keyboard.Like the saying goes, Buy it nice or buy it twice!",111,1.0,2022,09,September,10
Not just for Gamers,4,"I got this keyboard because my computer is not under direct light, and at night, it's difficult or impossible to see what you're typing. I can use this in the dark and it only stays lit when in use, so it's not glowing all day long. The rainbow colors are pretty. I only wish it had a volume button. You can push FN(function) & F4, but I would have liked just and up/down/mute feature somewhere.",75,5.0,2022,09,September,09
How colorful!,2,Great keyboard. Easy on/off switch. Hooks up to Bluetooth easily. And the rainbow lights are lovely!,16,5.0,2022,09,September,07
"Overall great, but I wish there were options to change the time-out",12,"Overall I'm really happy with this purchase. The keys feel nice and are quiet. (Someone else's review said that the space bar is very loud, and while it is louder than the other keys it's not obnoxiously so.) The battery seems to keep it going for a very long time and still works while it's charging. My biggest issue (which is not actually a big deal) is that I could change the settings for the backlight time-out. The lights on the board go out after 60 seconds, I wish I could edit that so they stay on longer. Especially since the keys are really hard to see it's dark in the room and the light is off. Another small detail I wish this had included is that most gaming keyboards I've had in the past have a little nub on the W, in addition to the F and the J keys like all keyboards have. This doesn't and I find myself missing that.I also think it should be noted because I didn't see it anywhere when I was buying it, that the colors are in a  rainbow pattern (seen in the photo) and cannot be changed from that. I just assumed that could be changed but it doesn't seem like it can",212,4.0,2022,09,September,07

Good keyboard but only has one set of lights. The way you see in pic is how it is.,19,"This is a great keyboard and I like it. However I do wish there were more light effects than featured. The lights are as shown in the picture. They can be set to stay a solid color or to strobe on and off. You can adjust the brightness of the lights as well. As far as the lights what you see in the description picture is exactly what you get. Other than the lights you are able to hold down the function key and press other keys to control the volume of your computer and play, skip forward, skip backward, and stop play buttons. Theres a couple other hotkeys you can use but are useless to myself and likely everyone else under the age of 50-60.",126,4.0,2022,09,September,07
"A decent keyboard if you just want a cheapy ""RGB"" wireless keyboard",12,"So all in all for 30$ this thing is fine. The ""RGB"" is NOT actually RGB instead featuring the average RGB rainbow.

I then grabbed the other one and started using it on my fulltime  PC and it died today.

Love The Colors  Light,4,"I especially dislike the fact that the rgb turns itself off after a minute or so of no use. I purchased this keyboard because the one I had did that. If your playing a game and using a mouse or game controller, then you don't need the key oard much but when you do, you can't see which button is which until you strike a key and activate the lighting! What's the point in rgb lights if they don't just stay on? I guess I'll be buying a third keyboard, but this time I'll make sure it isn't practically useless to me. Probably go Newegg!",105,5.0,2022,07,July,12

Why does everyone hate it???,5,"I work from home and purchased this keyboard for my work computer. I prefer the backlit keys for work and usually the letters don’t wear off as quickly. This worked great for about 2-3 weeks and then it was no longer a quiet keyboard, my kids complain about how loud it is even 2 rooms away and it misses keys when I type, or double types a letter when I pushed it once. So if you like purchasing something that works for 2 weeks and then sucks, this is the keyboard for you. Otherwise keep shopping lol",97,5.0,2022,07,July,07

Great,1,"So I got this to replace my drab old keyboard and I'm glad I did. The fact that it's rechargeable was a big sell for me! And the very light texture feel nice to touch. The only problem (though not a game changer for me) I'm having is that the main ENTER button feels further away (or maybe it's smaller?) than what I'm used to.But overall, it's a thumbs up!",70,5.0,2022,06,June,30
Would never buy again,4," It just came in the keyboard is exactly what they said it's pretty quiet, led feature, well packaged.  Shout out to Amazon driver for delivering my package safely I recommend this product to everyone.",34,1.0,2022,06,June,27

Nice Keyboard,2,"Only had the item for a bit over a month and started having issues with the keyword would not working.  I would plug it in to charge and it wouldworks for awhile then start having issues,  would not type.  I would pull the USB connector out of my computer and put back in and it would work for a short time.  I dealt with this for a couple of days but then no longer could tolerate the keyboard not working.  Went out and bought me a different keyboard.  I work from home and have to have a reliable keyboard.",99,4.0,2022,06,June,26
CTRL+SHIFT Works,2,"I have had this keyboard for well over a month now, it is cordless and rechargeable. The great thing about it is that when the battery needs a charge, I can plug it in with the supplied USB cord and still use the keyboard while it is charging. the keys are backlit with the light coming through each keys letter not just around them, the lights turn off after a short time of non-use but light back up with the tap of any key. I would buy this again without hesitation if needed.",93,4.0,2022,06,June,25
Easy to use,3,"I have been looking for a wireless keyboard with back light and came across this one.  I am really enjoying it, No I am not a gamer, I am using this for work, I like the lights on the keyboard, it's really light weight and it does not take up a lot of space. The only issue is one of the Shift key is loose, but it's not that bad to a point where it needs to be returned for me that's just my opinion. The keyboard only lights up when it's in use then after a few minutes it goes into sleep mode and that's not a issue for me.",111,5.0,2022,06,June,25
It works good,3,"Seems to me that the left CTRL + SHIFT issue has been resolved. I can go into Adobe Illustrator and press CTRL+SHIFT V and it will copy and paste in place for me. That's all I really use it for.Lighting: Isn't too bright but has a nice ambiance to it. No adjustment like their mouse. Their mouse as a driver which can control more, wish the keyboard had that.Keys: I had a slim keyboard before and I like playing on that a little bit more. Keys are fairly quiet. The keys are also taller so my fingers need to get used to it a bit more.Bluetooth Connectivity: Seems to be working good, didn't have any input lag",117,3.0,2022,06,June,23

this keyboard disconnects and doesnt work,6,"I use it for work (time keeping) and it does everything I need it to: light for caps lock, ease of inputting shortcuts, comfortable for typing since it has two stands in the back, lights up so I can see the keys when I don't feel like turning on the lights in my office. Great product",56,1.0,2022,06,June,16
great keyboard,2,Good lighting on the keys for typing in low lighting. Comfortable typing. Perfect keyboard size not huge but not tiny either.

Not functional after 4 months,5,"I often - as we all do - use my laptop in less than bright conditions and prefer a keyboard that flashes along with my typing.This one was purchased for when I'm up at our cabin. I had received it in March, took it up then hadn't used it again until recently in June when I went back up. I was typing away and caught that the letter z wasn't working. Since I have one of those in my name it's sorta important. I pulled out the information in the little black envelope that came with the keyboard and found it to be entertaining.I sent a message to Contact Us and Vincent replied. He's the man with the hats. ;-)All is well, my replacement flashes, the Z and the 5 (discovered that afterwards) all are present now. The new one also has fully lit characters which led me to realize that they all were only half-lit with the first keyboard.I highly recommend this keyboard and KLIM Technologies!",167,1.0,2022,06,June,14
Perfect!,1,"I am not using the keyboard for gaming.  I use it for everyday use of my personal computer.  I love how it lights up so I can see the keys without turning on the light in my office as an option.  The keys fell easy to press down on, and it just feels comfortable to use.After 4 years I also had an issue with one of the keys cracking and was very pleased that KLIM Replaced the keyboard per their warranty.  Thank you very much to them.",87,5.0,2022,06,June,14

Buyer beware! Will break after light use and company refuses to do anything,13,"Ok...the good...Small company. I like supporting that.  Great packaging.  They have an insert that tells you about the team that designed the keyboard. The construction is solid, doesn't feel like junk.  Well made.What....could be better....The brightness of the colors in the photo is not what you are going to see in the product.  You can SEE the colors, but it's not very bright.  This is simply a light behind the keys, but considering it's connected to your computer, it should be brighter because it has continuous power source.What....is....jeez...not good.The key placement.  It's ""off"".  I understand that anytime you get a new keyboard that your fingers have to learn where the keys are.  But as large as this keyboard is...it should be spaced just a little bit better to a standardized keyboard.  The return is WAY off.  I am keeping it because it matches my mouse and it's pretty.  I know my fingers will eventually learn to reach (yes, reach) for the return.  But right now it...sorry...just blows.The product has potential to be SUPER AMAZING and I have no doubt they have a production crew willing to get it there which is exactly why I took the time to write an honest and detailed review.",204,1.0,2022,06,June,09
Okay For The Price If You Like Proof-Reading,8,Wanted to like this since it was cheaper for a wireless keyboard with backlighting. With in a month or 2 of normal use the letters and numbers wore off. That I could live with but then the one of the shift keys broke in half and made this unusable. Again this was with normal office use no gaming no smashing keys.,61,2.0,2022,06,June,08

NOT for touch typists,4,"Looks pretty but not very responsive. I use it at work and have to back up and re-read everything I type as it misses letters, adds extras if you even brush them with your finger, which is the only time it works really well, and I spend way more time than I should proof-reading to make sure the keyboard isn't making look like I can't type.",66,3.0,2022,06,June,06
Keyboard looks as pictured on website.,6,"bought this to get rid of wires on my desk and it has been great. but the battery doesn't last as long as I expected, and that's with the backlights turned off. I was also disappointed to find that not all USB-c cables work to charge it. I lost the cable that comes with the keyboard to charge it and when it died only one of my 7 USB-c cables would charge it and I found that really strange. not totally sure why that is but it's something that I noticed. so if you don't have a lot of USB-c cables, don't lose the one that comes with it otherwise you might not be able to charge it.otherwise, I like it, haven't had any problems other than what is mentioned.",130,2.0,2022,06,June,05
says water proof...but stopped working after water spill,8,"NOT FOR TOUCH TYPING/KEYBOARDING:  Backstory--I bought two of these -- one I use in my classroom so when I'm in the front of my room I can type urls or hit the escape button.  I love that it is back-lit as I often have lights off in my room during presentations or videos.  HOWEVER -- I bought a second one for home and CANNOT type on it.  I am old-school and learned touch-typing, and do so at a very fast pace.  But this keyboard HAS AN EXTRA KEY between the letter L and the Enter key.  Therefore I hit that key instead of the enter key every time -- very frustrating.  Quickly returned it as it is useless to me.",120,1.0,2022,06,June,03

She instructed me what to do to identify my Amazon order number and I emailed it back to her.  5 hours later I got a response with instructions on trouble shooting the problem. It did in fact turn out to be the dongle.  I emailed back our findings and almost immediately got a response from Lolita that she was shipping a complete new keyboard and dongle.  Her reason was ""in case it wasn't the dongle she did not want to disappoint my grandson  by having to wait for additional resolution"".2 days later I received the new keyboard and all is well.I believe the Customer Service is in the UK.

Perfect for my needs,4,"I'm in the process of trying to find a replacement keyboard for the logitech k800, and this ain't it either. I tried another keyboard before this one and it didn't cut it at all. The illumination on this KLIM is worse than the Deluxe I tried first. With the brightness turned all the way up and the keyboard freshly charged it is very dim and hard to read, especially all around the outside edge of the keys/keyboard. Another minus is that every time you stop typing it turns off (the illumination). Yes it does come back on when you start typing but when you can't see which keys are which it's hard to find the correct key to press without messing up your work. It is also a fairly small keyboard, a little bigger than the Deluxe but not much. Once again the old adage, 'you get what you pay for' comes into play. Still looking.",156,5.0,2022,04,April,25

Excited for years of use to come from this thing.",77,5.0,2022,04,April,21
Enter key is not shaped like 'regular' keyboards,8,"For the price of the keyboard....The quality is outstanding. Great feel, built well, looks nice, overall 10/10. Came in a nice sleek package with stickers (as do all their products).All i can say is get yourself one and check it out yourself. Now for gaming it does great, but if your serious tournament status then obviously you'll need a wired keyboard. Other than that any games you enjoy  playing will do fine. I personally play GTA V RP and I've had no problems works flawlessly.All my FPS have no issues either. I can move around and keys work in sync just fine. Multiple keys at once works. All around great.I have a mouse as well and same thing 10/10. If your hesitant due to to the pricing. Don't be, you'll be happy and glad you made the purchase.I was skeptical myself and wasn't expecting the quality to be that great. I took the chance and am glad I did.

Too dim and can't adjust timeout period.,7,This keyboard is worthless! It only lasted 2 months before it started cutting in and out.

Quality,1,I use this at work. It's great. Everyone asks me about my keyboard all the time. I have ADHD and it actually helps me focus.,25,5.0,2022,04,April,19
Great bang for your buck,5,"I like the keyboard for all of its features except for one: The enter key. It's difficult to touch-type due to the weird shape of the key. I keep hitting the backslash key when I really want to hit the enter key. Normally the backslash key would be located on the end and right above the enter key. This won't be a problem for those who don't touch type but for those of us who do, it's an impossible reach when trying to fly at 85 words per minute. For this reason I don't recommend this particular keyboard. I'm going to be looking for a new keyboard.",107,5.0,2022,04,April,18
"Very nice soft/""clicky"" keys and feels nice to type. Compatible with my Windows and Mac laptops",16,"Lights are very dim and cut off after 30 seconds. No way to change it. This wouldn't be a problem per se but the letters on the keyboard are very dark white. Even with the lights in the room on they are hard to see until you press a button to get the backlight on. So if you use your keyboard in a darkish room - this is a hard pass. I don't have to look at my keyboard to type, but if I have let the backlight go out while I think about something else and my hands leave the keyboard ....I have to spend a few seconds orientating my hands at the correct spot. This is a real pain. Also not as quiet as they make it sound. I've had cheaper non-name wired keyboards that were almost completely silent.",141,4.0,2022,04,April,17
Awkward enter key placement/shape,4,"First off, this keyboard has been nice to type on considering the price. At first, the keys were a bit too soft and required slightly more pressure to press, but as I typed more on it, they loosened up and now feel great. The keys feel ""clicky"", but soft enough where it's not loud to type. The space bar is a bit louder, but not as loud compared to other keyboards. Works great as an external keyboard for my Windows and Mac laptops.I do wish the max brightness of the keys was higher as it's not as bright when the room light is on. Also, it would be nice to have the option to change the colors of the lights like other keyboards that are around the same price range, or cheaper. Lastly, it would be slightly less annoying to have the option to use the media keys without needing to press the FN key.For Macs:On my 2015 MacBook Pro with Mojave, I was able to change the settings to where the Ctrl key functions as the Command key on a Mac. You simply go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys... and ensure that the correct keyboard is selected on the top next to ""Select keyboard:"". For me, it was 2.4G Wireless Receiver. Once the correct keyboard is selected, I changed the Control Key: to Command and changed the Command Key: to Control. Now, the Ctrl key functions as the Command key.However, the Windows key functions as the Command key by default, so these steps are not necessary if you're okay using the Windows key.Overall, I would recommend it if you're on a budget and don't mind some of the drawbacks I mentioned. Still a great keyboard and battery life is pretty good.",295,4.0,2022,04,April,12

Wireless,1,"I like the feel of this keyboard. The back lighting works well. It's a solid keyboard. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the back slash key is next to the enter key.

At one point when rearranging my office space I lost the wireless receiver. I was very disappointed because it had been working great, so I reached out to the company directly to see if I could buy a new receiver as the keyboard was still working fine. They told me the wireless receiver was on backorder but they would replace it for free! I was very pleased with that solution. However, a few months went by and they told me they wouldn't be able to get me a replacement part. So they sent me a brand new keyboard! I highly recommend this product and this company.",131,5.0,2022,03,March,26

Decent as a keyboard; Back-lit function weak,7,"Ergonomically, it's nice.  A little clickier than I expected.  The lights aren't as bright as I expected and the charge seems to be not very long.

Comfort.,1,"If you just need a wireless keyboard it is as decent as any other - no complaints in terms of typing.. The back-lit function however is very weak.. the brightest setting really does not brighten the key lettering so you can see in a darkened room what you're typing..  The backlit is just very nice-looking dressing that brightens under the keys and constantly shuts off so you have to click something then undo before u can type with the fancy light.. On a practical level, the back-light is really useless.. Just nice to look at.. nothing more",97,4.0,2022,03,March,04
This keyboard is great,4,I'm not a PC gamer but I spend a lot of time on my personal PC during the day. I wanted something inexpensive with backlit keyboard and a number pad and this fits the bill.

"Awesome keyboard, amazing customer service!",5,Cheap product. Did not last long and wireless connectivity is horrible,11,5.0,2022,03,March,01
Quality wireless keyboard with moderate battery life,7,"I ordered this keyboard a few months ago and absolutely love it.I mainly use my keyboard for school and casual gaming. It charges quickly and lasts a very long time, the connectivity was simple and consistent, and the quality was just as good if not BETTER than my boyfriends Corsair keyboard that is nearly four times the price. They keyboard itself has a great feel to it - The keys are not too loud, and it does not have that ""cheap hollow plastic"" feeling like most budget gaming keyboards do.What makes this product even better is the excellent company behind it. A few weeks ago my dongle stopped working (highly likely it was a user-error, I commute with my laptop quite a bit and tend to forget to remove my dongle). I reached out to their incredibly friendly customer service and after some troubleshooting and confirming it was not a software problem, they promised to send me out a new dongle once they got back in stock.  A week or two went by, and just when I thought maybe I was out of luck, I received an email from Lolita informing me that since their replacement dongles were still out of stock, they would be shipping me a brand new keyboard! I had the new keyboard at my doorstep in two days, just in time for my online mid-term. In my experience, most tech companies completely forget about their customers or blow them off when it comes to little things like this.I already loved my KLIM keyboard, but we are now officially a ""KLIM household"".  I highly recommend buying their products.",271,4.0,2022,02,February,23

Functional and Pretty With One Major and Two Minor Flaws,10,"Great keyboard for the price. I love the feel, though somehow I do feel it isn't as ""hefty"" when typing than I'm used to. Some people might like this light feel. I prefer heavier response when I click. Work from home coder, so I use it on average minimum 5hours daily. It's lasted approx 20 days on a single charge, not bad at all, if you charge it overnight once a week, you shouldn't have any problems with it dying randomly. The auto sleep feature is nice to prolong the battery, but when I'm working it can be a like off putting that the lights go out, vs them constantly being on.",112,3.0,2022,02,February,19
Typos galore,2,"They moved the back slash (\) and Pipe command key down next to the (""') key and made the enter key taller. I keep hitting the \ key instead of the enter key.",33,1.0,2022,02,February,17
Keyboard Squeeze after 60 days of use,7," This was a pretty good buy, and it’s actually better than I thought. It’s pretty quiet when typing and very smooth. I love how it goes to sleep mode after a few seconds. The lights on the keyboard are nice and vibrant. Much better than I thought it would be. Comes with a usb to C cord for lightning fast charging. Only charged it once on Friday and it’s still going. We’ll see how long the keyboard’s power will last. Will definitely keep you guys posted. Other than that, no complaints so far!",93,1.0,2022,02,February,10
Backlighting goes off way too quickly. Then battery died after six months,12,"This keyboard is decent. It types well, has a good tactile response, and an easy to adjust-to layout.  In addition, the RGB backlight works great and looks good. Minor Flaw 1: The flip-out legs to prop the keyboard to a more ergonomic position tend to close easily from the pressure of typing or gaming. Minor Flaw 2: If you type all day and game all night, this is not the keyboard for you since the battery life when subjected to all-day activity is relatively short. I have to charge the keyboard literally five times as often as my wireless mouse of a different brand. Major Flaw:  Given that battery life is not where I would like it to be, the biggest problem with this keyboard is that there is absolutely no warning that the battery on the keyboard is low. You are typing or gaming and the keyboard suddenly becomes non-responsive because the battery is suddenly dead. Of course, quickly resolved by plugging in the charging cord, but incredibly annoying and inconvenient. Overall, a decent keyboard, but not having any type of warning that the battery is almost dead is really annoying since having to stop and plug it in often causes the loss of train of thought when working or the death of my avatar when gaming. Pretty lights, though.",221,1.0,2022,02,February,10

After using it for less than 60 days the keyboard squeezes on several keys when I push it including the space bar.  It is very annoying so I plan on trashing it since it is past the return date. I purchased this keyboard because I wanted a light-up keyboard.  I use it for work. Too much noise!",68,1.0,2022,02,February,07
Horrible Keyboard,2,"UPDATE:  After six months the keyboard has died. Won't hold a charge any more. My whole experience with this thing has been negative and I would strongly recommend against buying one. (Even if it is $10 cheaper than when I bought it.)Original review, when I gave it three stars:  I bought this primarily because I wanted a wireless backlit keyboard. And this one lights up well. Only it goes off after only about a minute and leaves me in the dark. You of course only have to punch a key to bring the lights back, but it still interrupts my whole process when I'm working. It has a  nice touch, which was why I bought a gaming keyboard even though I don't play games, and I would otherwise like the keyboard. But this feature leaves me contemplating buying a different brand. Drives me crazy.",144,1.0,2022,02,February,01
Super fast and quiet.,4, I tried everything i contacted the support through the website and no response since Feb 6th after the day i got the item (its the 9th rn of Feb) and so i waited a little longer for a response but nothing and so I tried to connect the cord to the item... Again nothing and the usb as you can see in the video is connect to my computer and i tried connecting it to other ports in the computer but nothing else work i also tried with the charging cable to see if that would work but nothing again :/ so i am disappointed in the product,108,5.0,2022,02,February,01
Stopped working after two weeks,5,"I picked this up because I was looking for a QUIET wireless keyboard.  The reviews and product information said this was the one for me, but it's disappointing.  The keys are quiet, but the space bar is so loud and rickety that it more than makes up for the quiet keys.  And since I'm using this to type all day and not game, the space bar gets hit a lot.  I'll deal with it, and the other features of the keyboard are fine, but this is a disappointment to me.",90,1.0,2022,01,January,12

As described,2,"I'm kind of unsure how this has so many great reviews. I'm on my second in only 6 months. sometimes the keys randomly stop working or things like the scroll lock just randomly turn on when you have never touched it. on mine, the sicker where it tells you if the caps and num lock are activated is already starting to pull off. Again this is only after 3 months, I do use it daily but that really shouldn't matter.Also, the space bar is super loud and inconsistent.But if you are like me your would rather troubleshoot something instead of wasting something and just throwing it out. Tried contacting the company, but that's literally nonexistent - Amazon just kept giving me to the wrong site and there's not a number or email. you go to contact them from amazon and they bring you to a winter outerwear site...those clearly aren't the same companies. Would have loved some help instead of throwing this thing in the trash, trying not to be wasteful here.The battery will die randomly with no warning. super inconvenient when you're just trying to work.",187,4.0,2022,01,January,31
Good keyboard for the money,5,"This keyboard may look cool, but that's about it.  The keys are not button-like, like the one brand I normally use, so typing with average size nails is difficult.

I understand that it has an energy saver to keep you from constantly recharging it, but 60 seconds would have been perfect. You barely can enjoy the effects. As far as being loud, it's not loud to me. I don't what kind of silent vortex these other people need to be in, but it's a quiet enough keyboard.",81,1.0,2022,01,January,17
It's fine for the price but not great,8,"Control+Shift+N doesn't work. I saw this in other older reviews, but this was supposed to be a new 2022 version of the keyboard so hoped it was fixed. Nope. Before all the other features, backlighting, ergonomics etc, a keyboard needs to allow you to press keys and have those keys go to the computer. I use this combo constantly for work to login to sites as different users or without cookies.Not taking what I type and send it to the computer is a non starter for me. Even if you don't use this combo a lot, there might be other combos that don't work and just out of principal I don't think it's a good idea to support a product that doesn't actually allow you to type something and have it go to the computer.",135,3.0,2022,01,January,17

Excellent product,2,I bought one for my grandson and he seemed to like it for gaming.  We had to return the first one for the same reason.  So that was two.  His second one is still working so we decided it must have been an isolated incident. I wanted the colored backlighting as well and it was still rated higher than most so I purchased one for myself. Bad idea. This morning it worked when I signed in to my computer and then stopped working in the middle of a meeting.  Do not trust this product.  I cannot even return the most recent one and I do not understand why. Out of 40 bucks.,112,5.0,2022,01,January,12

It looks great; quiet keys that are very responsive. He can also use it from the couch when he hooks the computer up to the TV (the usb is behind a table and on the bottom shelf of our entertainment, about 4 feet away).While I was writing this, I asked him if he had an criticisms and he said that it charges fine but the charger can feel like it’s hard to get in or not in all the way, but again, no issues charging. I’d just be mindful of that. 🙂",108,1.0,2022,01,January,11
Just what I wanted!,4,"The attached picture is for a review of the stickers (the letter ""A"") that I had to buy for this keyboard. If you look at the paint that outlines the ""s"" key, it's wearing off. Other keys are wearing off, too, and once they wear off, you can't see the letters. You just see globs of colored light. What use is an illuminated keyboard if you can't see the keys? What's more, if you don't touch the keyboard for 30 seconds, the illumination disappears and the keyboard is completely dark (even when it's plugged in). The only way to ""wake"" it is to touch the keyboard again, so now you have keystrokes on your screen, in your document, on your game, etc., that you didn't want. I know keyboards wear out, but I've only had this one for a few months.**Very shortly after I submitted this review and after I took the time to add all of the stickers to the keyboard, it began to malfunction and add characters that I wasn't even typing. I gave up and retired it after about 7 months.****UPDATE--I never contacted the seller about the keyboard. When they saw the feedback, they reached out TO ME and replaced the keyboard for free without having to return the defective product.

I have placed probably over 1000 orders over Amazon, and I do not generally leave reviews, but this company stuck out so I wanted to give them a shout out.",70,5.0,2022,01,January,09
No Volume Control,3,Cracked really fast. Illumination isn't very bright. Stand by mode turns off lights. Very light and slick. Sometimes hard to hold if you need to move it. Lights do not flicker.Just cheap.,32,2.0,2022,01,January,03
Keys stroke,2,"After using a game controller (which was touchy and took forever to enter search information), sprung for this great looking and easy to use keyboard.  The backlit feature is a must, and it paired perfectly with an Xbox One S console. Charging was a snap, and it's just what you need if you're doing a lot of searches on your preferred streaming services.  Would be helpful if the instructions included more information on key functions.",75,5.0,2022,01,January,03
Son Loves!,2,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. I unfortunately I bought it early and the return window is closed.This keyboard will not connect to his computer.

Was Great at First…,4,"I purchased this on Dec 4 ,  Just about a month I've been using it.  Just quit working today.  Turned off and back on  and restarted computer .  Still doesn't work.  So I'm not happy I got  only a month out of it and it stopped working.",47,1.0,2022,01,January,01

Keys are not silent,4,"The product was quite obviously not new - the product box (not the shipping box) was damaged and had return labels peeled off; the keyboard had a corner broken off and there was dust all over it; the dongle for wireless use was not included, nor were any cords.  Horrible experience.",51,1.0,2021,12,December,26
"It's nice, but bad Enter key position",7,"I bought by keyboard in 2020, had no issues until 1 of the keys started getting stuck after heavy use (about 12 hours per day for a year). Contacted customer service since it was under warranty and was sent a brand new keyboard instantly without an exchange. I would strongly recommend this company and their products",56,3.0,2021,12,December,25
Awesome teenage son loves it,5,"Item worked well when it worked, but it no longer charges after 6 months of use.  USB on keyboard doesn’t seem to work anymore.

I thought it was a MECHANICAL keyboard.,7,"I didn't even notice until I started typing on it, but the forward slash key is to the left of the enter key instead of above, so I always accidentally hit it instead of the enter key. Nothing bad to say about the keyboard otherwise, just a strange design. I'll probably hang onto it as a backup, but the weird key placement is a dealbreaker for me.",67,3.0,2021,12,December,15

Good buy!,2,arrived on time as exactly as described .  The key board is wireless and works great .  The battery lasts a long time,23,5.0,2021,12,December,14
I expected a lot more. Nothing like what is advertised.,10,"I started using this keyboard and it was perfect... until I hit the spacebar.  The spacebar makes a rattling noise when you even touch it at all.  You don't even have to press it down.  It's unavoidable to make this sound no matter how gingerly you press the key.  Unless this was a single unit problem, this design is garbage as a ""silent keyboard"".",64,1.0,2021,12,December,07
good packaging,2,"It feels cheap.  Compared to my Corsair, it is just average.  I'm sorry, but I am spoiled.  The only thing it has going for it is that it is wireless, which is why I will keep and use it.  The keyboard seems to be smaller.  I am a touch typist and my fingers feel cramped.  I think it impedes my typing speed; I'm pretty good at above 75 wpm.  I don't use it for gaming, I write voraciously, and need a keyboard that has quick response.  This one is ummmmm... just okay.",92,4.0,2021,12,December,07
Enter key is not wide enough,6,"I don't write reviews very often but I will make an exception for this piece of junk. Were you wanting a wireless keyboard? Because this is not wireless. It requires a usb cable for power. Oh, yes indeedy! And so now you are using not one but TWO of your USB ports for this BS. What a waste of time",60,3.0,2021,11,November,30
Love it ❤,3,"After using it for a couple hours on its initial charge, I plugged it in using the given charging cable but it would never charge. I plugged it in to my computer, the wall, and with a different usb-c charger and nothing worked. I cannot recommend anyone to purchase this product when it does not charge properly. If it worked I would have given it a 5 star review because it looks nice, has RGB, and had very little latency despite being wireless. Do not buy this product.",88,5.0,2021,11,November,30
Love it!,2,"I like this keyboard very much, but was hoping for something a bit smaller or thinner per se. It's a normal size keyboard, a little larger than expected.",28,5.0,2021,11,November,29
Worked great then stopped after 5 months,7,"I initially wrote a bad review about this keyboard.  I thought it stopped working.  It turns out someone removed the usb receiver from my hub.  My computer is in a dark spot in the basement so I didn't notice.  The Klim keyboard is awesome.  Great battery life, quiet and feels amazing!",51,1.0,2021,11,November,29
Charges fast holds long charge,5,"Here are a few major issues - I bought this keyboard for 4 main reasons: It was supposed to be ergonomic, silent, lit up, and good qualityErgonomic: This is not ergonomic. It's a black ordinary keyboard with some lights.Silent Keyboard: This is NOT silent. It is the loudest keyboard I have had in years.Lights: I thought you could decide what lights shine through the keyboard, NOPE! You get to pick how bright it is, and whether it's solid, ""breathing"", flickering, or off. The color pattern never changes. The worst part is after 30 seconds of not using the keyboard all of the lights turn off, which is really problematic when it's dark and you are relying on the lights to see they letters.Quality: It feels like cheap plastic. Overall I give this a 1/5 stars, would not purchase it again.",140,4.0,2021,11,November,29
"Used to be good, now it doesn't work!!",8,"so far so good although my first impression is that putting the on/off switch underneath is stupid.lights going off after a minute is problematic in the dark unless you really know your touch-typing.fn+pause =  lights high, low or offif reviews are accurate, now I'll wait to see if I got one that lasts.",53,1.0,2021,11,November,29
Poor quality,2,This is a great keyboard except for the fact that the enter key is not wide enough. The backslash key takes the place of where the first bit of the enter key should go. Will probably end up returning because I don't want to relearn how to type to make up for a smaller enter key.,56,1.0,2021,11,November,24
"The ""Enter Key"" is too Large!!",6,"Bought this for a family member and decided I wanted one as well. Worked like a cha for both of us, also I lo e the way it sounds.",29,2.0,2021,11,November,23
"So far, I LOVE IT!",5,"I was a little apprehensive about buying this keyboard at first because I didn’t want anything shaped too “gamey”, or angular, I guess you could say- but I was too impatient to wait another 24 hours for a different style to ship out :) so I jumped on this one and I don’t even notice the shape anymore at all. I love this keyboard. The keys are not completely silent but almost the perfect amount of soft “clickiness”; just enough to let you know you’ve hit a key. The colors are vibrant and so fun, even in broad daylight. So far battery life is great. Love that you can charge and still use it at the same time (some won’t allow this). The only thing I’ll have to get used to is the enter/return key is about an inch farther to the right than I’m used to, but that matters less to me every day. Very happy!",157,4.0,2021,11,November,22
Not for gaming!,3,Kind of bummed. Worked great for 5 months and now won’t charge so not useable. Kid isn’t a hard gamer so didn’t use but once or twice a week. Maybe others had better luck but it’s a no go for us.,41,1.0,2021,11,November,22
Works great,2,Great battery life. Still feels flimsy and sometimes the keys are delayed.,12,5.0,2021,11,November,21
Great battery life,3,This was good for a couple weeks and then the reception became extremely poor. I would personally go for another keyboard in my opinion.Also Amazon will not refund it. BS if you ask me! Just go with a wired keyboard!,40,5.0,2021,09,September,27
Hardware Issue Renders this UNUSABLE for work,7,"Bought this at the end of September... It's about 2 months now and for the past several weeks the keyboard hasn't been working. I've tried everything. It lights up when I click keys, but it doesn't type and then the RGB colors just go away. It was constantly plugged in since the battery life was terrible. But now it looks like I wasted money and will need to go back to my old keyboard. Find a different keyboard, don't buy this!!",81,1.0,2021,11,November,20
Not great,2,"When received there was a mystery liquid on the number pad. I chose to assume maybe a it was a cleaning fluid of some sort, wiped it off and moved on with my life. Its supposedly water proof per advertisement right? Keyboard works fine while plugged in and has quiet keys but will not hold a charge. Advertised as bluetooth and has a bluetooth connector but only working as a wired keyboard at this point and the backlight is super dim, even at the highest ‘brightness’. Maybe mine was faulty but personally, do not recommend.",95,3.0,2021,11,November,18

Solid Keyboard,2,I purchased this keyboard because it was wireless and it claimed it would be great for gaming with fast response time. That my friends is a joke! When I can actually get the keyboard to turn on.. it takes several moments for it to reconnect (it goes into sleep mode all the time) and getting they keys to respond is extremely hard! I do not in any way recommend this keyboard! It also says 30 feet… your lucky to get 10 feet before you start having connectivity issues!,88,5.0,2021,11,November,17
It stopped working in 1 month with light use,9,"It’s smaller than I’m used to and light. The battery seems to work well and I don’t turn on and off, just goes to sleep. It has the enter bar in a different configuration and is tighter than I’m than used to and that has been a change to get accustomed to. I like it though.",56,1.0,2021,11,November,16
"It works well, but distance of Bluetooth can be limiting.",10,"Left CTRL + Shift + __ keyboard shortcuts are unresponsive on this keyboard, meaning this is unusable for my workflow.  I don't know how this keyboard is rated so highly and continues to be sold with KNOWN hardware issues like this. Also the spacebar makes an awful twang noise when it's tapped.",52,5.0,2021,11,November,13
Won’t charge,2,"Keys are very clickety/loud and the space bar literally squeaks. Battery charge doesn’t last long and cuts out completely with no warning. Is NOT functional while charging plugged into the computer. Otherwise, I suppose it’s functional. Backlighting is nice to have, though I’m sure it drains the battery more quickly. No obvious way to turn that feature off when not needed.",61,3.0,2021,11,November,12
Nice looking keyboard and great customer support!,7,"I barely use my keyboard. I sit on couch and watch Netflix etc aka don't even use it for gaming. And after like 6 months at least the V button the 1 button don't work whatsoever. They say the keyboard lasts at least a decade.....hmmmmmmm. Buy something else, as now I have to as well",55,5.0,2021,11,November,10
Works great but wish the lights stayed on longer when idle,11,"There is lot of delay when we use numpad.

meh,1,"This is a great keyboard for the price.The keys are mushy, it’s not particularly comfortable, and it runs out of battery more quickly than I’d like.BUT it’s water proof, consistent, and INEXPENSIVE. if you’re someone like me who has a history of drowning expensive keyboards in water, look no further.I’ve already tried to ruin this keyboard a couple of times, but a quick wipe down and it keeps chugging along.This is a tremendous keyboard for the price.",77,2.0,2021,11,November,04
Great keyboard,2,I splurged and bought an expensive keyboard.  It stopped working in 1 month with light use. I tried to resync the dongle and spent several hours troubleshooting.  I am totally disappointed.,31,5.0,2021,11,November,03

It worked great for a few months and then one of the keys (""j"") started to misbehave. Not having time to deal with it I put it to the side and forgot about it. After picking it back up and trying again more of the keys had stopped working (about 2 years later). I reached out to customer service siting the 5 year warranty and they were absolutely wonderful (both helpful and very nice) and replaced the product.

Does not like fast typing people,6,"I got this when it was on sale for 50% off and I consider myself to have been ripped off. This keyboard sucks. It sometimes works, sometimes it doesnt... even keeping it plugged in (defeating the whole purpose of a wireless keyboard) doesn't guarantee it will work. The lights are cool, or whatever, but they don't make up have unconscionably awful it is. Even something as simple as writing this review is taking three times longer than it should.

Worst,1,"I bought this keyboard because it was one of the cheaper ones with decent reviews and I have to admit for the first month or so it was great but now it doesn’t connect well wirelessly and it’s a hassle to try and get it to register the keys I’m pressing which is frustrating. When I first got it, there were no issues and it was comfortable enough to use like most standard keyboards and the RGBs are nice but the sleep mode gets a tad bit annoying after a while.",91,5.0,2021,10,October,23
I love it!,3,"I had this keyboard for 11 months and recently, as other reviewers have mentioned, the Bluetooth receiver fell apart. It was kind of loose in the USB port for a while, but I managed to leave it alone. However, packing and unpacking my laptop more than usual on a business trip jiggled it enough that it came out. Except the shell of the receiver is still stuck in the port, I will have to take it somewhere to have a professional use pliers and whatever to unstick that without damaging the laptop as I would likely do on my own. While it was working the keyboard performed fine. I only had to plug it in to charge it a few times. Since it didn't even last a year because one of the most essential elements was made with shoddy materials I have to give 2 stars though.",147,4.0,2021,10,October,22
Not worth your $$,4,"I type fast. I don’t know how many words a minute, but it’s fast. This silly thing won’t keep up with me. I have to constantly stop and backspace to retype. It’s pretty, good battery life but if you type fast you might want to look elsewhere",47,1.0,2021,10,October,21

Love this keyboard,3,"comfortable keyboard,very good must have!",5,5.0,2021,09,September,20
Awesome,1,"My husband is a gamer and was in need of a new keyboard. He chose this one because it had everything he wanted and needed, especially the wireless feature as he likes to lay back and not worry about dealing with cords. I'm pretty sure he dropped it on his desk a few times and it is still going. The colors are vibrant, types well and looks very nice. Highly recommend this great value!",74,5.0,2021,09,September,18
Top notch customer service,4,Good enough keyboard. Really regret getting it though as I have to charge it every week so it would have been better for me to have just gotten a wired keyboard or one that takes batteries.,36,5.0,2021,09,September,18
Love it,2,New Outcome:I had issues with my 1st keyboard. I reached out to the seller and they helped me troubleshoot my device until we figured it needed to be replaced.They gladly sent me a new keyboard which is now working as expected.  Will definitely recommend this brand._____________Old review:This keyboard is rechargable and does NOT have an option fir batteries. It worked for a month and half. It doesnt hold charge. Mine diesn't work at all. I wasted $40 and now I need to buy another keyboard.,85,5.0,2021,09,September,17
Warning do not buy,4,Finally got it to connect and it doesn't register most keystrokes. There website doesn't have a driver to download. Unsure how to resolve this problem. This is a paper weight at the moment.,33,1.0,2021,09,September,17
TRUST THE MOST RECENT REVIEWS--AVOID THIS KEYBOARD AT ALL COSTS!,10,"I am very much a ""casual"" gamer but even so, I would not recommend this keyboard to anyone.  Latency is awful, keystrokes are either missed or repeated - which means I wouldn't even use this for office applications.  Yeah, it is ""cheap"", I guess, except that you might as well set your $40 on fire.  Why not save a little more and get something of quality that will actually hold up to the task(s) for which you bought it?  Also, you know it's mediocre junk when Amazon does not even want it sent back as a return...",97,2.0,2021,09,September,16
Decent but Glitchy and Awkward,5,"Took it out of the box, set it up, 30 minutes later it stopped working completely.",16,2.0,2021,09,September,16
Stopped working,2,Everything was good on except for the fact that the battery went bad really fast. Like within 20 hours of use. it would not hold any sort of charge after that.,31,1.0,2021,09,September,14
Terrible battery life,3,"I love this keyboard so much that I bought two. love the backlit lights , especially if you like to play games or just use in general in the dark or very low light, and not bad for its price.......",40,1.0,2021,09,September,14
Skip if you use keyboard shortcuts,6,"Wanted this for a living room computer. Put the Wifi reciever into a usb port in back of the pc by my tv and if I use the charging cable that came with it I got further away than using the Wifi component it seems.... which means you get between 4-6ft of range.For anything other than using it across a room it does seem responsive, easy to use, and other wise a great keyboard. But if you want to sit more than 5ft from your computer you may want something else.",91,1.0,2021,09,September,11
Does not come with a mouse. must be purchased seperately,10,"Good colors, fast shipping",4,4.0,2021,09,September,10
Fancy,1,"The cool features for gaming notwithstanding (multi-colored back-light keys that can ""breathe"" or ""rotate""), this is an excellent all-around multi-function keyboard for general PC workload, including function buttons that allow dimming, brightness, volume control, etc. Keys are responsive, and charge lasts about 4-5 hours of gaming, depending on usage and how bright the settings of the back-lighting for the keys are set. Plus, the customer service at KLIM is top-notch. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed.",77,5.0,2021,08,August,19
REALLY WANTED THIS TO WORK...,5,"This company deserves 5 stars for their incredibly prompt and wonderful customer service.  This company truly stands by their product.  My Klim keyboard stopped working after about 1.5 years.  Since they had a 5 year warranty, I reached out and they quickly responded. They asked me to shipped the defective keyboard back to them (they would refund the shipping cost) and they would also send me a new replacement keyboard in the meantime.  However, I realized I really don't care for this keyboard's layout. I don't use this keyboard for gaming, it's primarily for work. So the short ""Enter"" key was irritating at times.  Unlike standard keyboard, this one has three keys in between the ""L"" and ""Enter"" keys rather than just two keys like typical keyboards. So I declined their replacement offer. I didn't want to go through the shipping hassel for a replacement that I don't care for. I was just going to cut my loss, look for something else, and thought that was the end of it. However, they immediately offered me a full refund or the option to try the upgraded version that has the standard layout- the v2 light.  I opted for the latter.  The keys in the upgraded version are very quiet and feels a bit ""mushy"". But it works great and I highly recommend this company.  You can definitely purchase with confidence.  They really do stand behind their warranty and the level of customer service they provided was top notch.  They were extremely caring, easy, quick, and hassel free.",256,1.0,2021,09,September,10
Awful,1,"This is a great and affordable keyboard. Great response time, feels great to type on, useful in the dark, and long lasting battery.",23,1.0,2021,09,September,10
Great,1,"Very cheap for the price. I received the item and I did not work, some of the keys didnt work. Tired to return this item to Amazon but it is a non returnable item. even if it is broken. Now I am out 40 dollars. Beware stay away from this product",51,5.0,2021,09,September,09
Very nice!,2,"When in doubt, always look at the Most Recent reviews rather than Most Popular. I really wanted to like this keyboard. It started off fine, but then the battery would hold its charge less and less. Within a month of owning it, it needed to be plugged into the USB charger all of the time or else it would immediately lose its charge and turn off. So now I have a functionally wired keyboard after trying to buy a wireless one. Speaking of function, the numpad keys DO NOT WORK. And the USB C charging cable is ridiculously short, I have to use an extension cord just to use it on my standing desk. The USB C cable must be special, because none of the other USB-C cables I own work with it (Macbook, Oculus, Jabra, even a cable that specifically said it would work with this keyboard!). The RGB was one of the main reasons why I bought this keyboard but it leaves a lot to be desired--it's not that bright and isn't dynamic when typing. Save your money, unless you really want to spend $40 for a paper weight.",191,5.0,2021,09,September,09
Great But doesn't last,4,"At first glance, the keyboard looks and feels nice. The keys are decently silent (though very loud compared to my other low-profile minimalistic keyboard), and the RGB is cool. However, there are several design flaws that make it very annoying to use:1) The Function key is on the right-side of the spacebar, which is non-standard, so very weird to use2) Keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+I for dev tools in Chrome (I am a programmer) only works on the right-side of the keyboard, not the left which I'm used to and works on every other keyboard I've ever used => and the issue cannot be fixed with the Klim reset keyboard combo, so you're stuck with the issue3) The RGB is somewhat faint, and even on the static setting doesn't stay on; it dims after not very long at all of inactivity, making me have to constantly type to keep it onOverall, I would save your money. You could get a much better keyboard for the same price that doesn't have the glitches or annoyances. I'm honestly surprised this keyboard has so many good reviews and that Klim continues to sell a known defective product without offering returns. What a sham.",199,2.0,2021,09,September,07
Hooking it up to a power-bank DOES WORK!,8,I purchased this keyboard in January and it worked great.  Now it has stopped working.  I reinstalled the drives and still nothing. Hope they will stand by their product and send me a replacement.,34,5.0,2021,09,September,07
Cool but needs to be plugged in to work,9,This is functional in the sense that it does have keys.Too bad it has a 14 minute battery life and you cannot use it while it’s charging.Absolute trash product. Tempted to just throw it away.,35,3.0,2021,09,September,06
works good but cant change the colors,7,"If you're a programmer or generally use the CTRL/SHIFT key combo, please skip this. The left CTRL/SHIFT combination doesn't work so you'll have to retrain yourself to use the right only. Apparently this is a known and ongoing issue. It's not worth the time or effort.",46,3.0,2021,09,September,05
Matte finish -> sensory issue,5,I am still working with it to review the mouse connection and other parts and then other features to it. So far so good,24,4.0,2021,09,September,04
Missing Keystrokes,2,"The 5-year warranty reeled me in. Unfortunately, I needed the 10-Key feature to work and neither the light indicator nor the 10-Key functions worked. It also had initial charging issues. It took 3 days to charge. Then it was charging but not for very long (2-3 hrs). CS said the only option was to exchange so I did. The exchange charged right away but the 10-Key & CAPS indicator didn't work. The 10-Key functions didn't work either. The CS on the exchange told me that I could have just returned it the first time and not go through the exchange process. That process turnaround time was a couple of weeks lost. Spend more money and get a better keyboard, one with established reviews & a track record. In this case, a 5-year warranty was marketing only because the keyboard never performed at 100%.",143,2.0,2021,09,September,04
Was all good in the beginning,6,Worked for a single week before it stopped typing.,9,3.0,2021,09,September,03

Catches on Fire,3,"It failed after one month; I have to have the charging cable permanently connected or it goes dead.  In addition, it is rather bulky compared to other keyboards.  I am sorry I bought it and I missed the return deadline by one day!",43,1.0,2021,08,August,16
6 mths later...,3,Poorly built. Don’t order.,4,2.0,2021,08,August,16
Really great but could improve,5,The keyboard’s colors cannot be set to a single color but the brightness can be dimmed or turned off. The charge only lasts 2 days. The keys are very quiet (a feature I was looking for). I gave 4 stars due to the short battery life.,46,5.0,2021,08,August,16
Not really what I hoped for,6,"Well for starters you can't beat the price of a true-wireless computer keyboard. Like most of the other reviews I didn't care for the battery life. So after losing power one night and the battery had died in the keyboard I looked over to my power-bank and said to myself why not?Not only does it work, I can sit on the couch about 12 feet or so? from the TV and don't need to worry about the keyboard battery life nor having a super-long charging cable.*knocks on wood*So far the keyboard has been holding up, and can say that it has paid for its self. The only issue I have with it is the [Enter] button. I like to make ':\' emoji faces and every time I go to make one I always do ':' instead. Other then that great budget friendly keyboard.",143,3.0,2021,08,August,30
"TOO SLOW, NOT GOOD QUALITY",5,"Very cool keyboard. Works great. But after a couple of weeks (after return window closed), it will only work when plugged into power. Kinda defeats the point of having a wireless keyboard.",32,1.0,2021,08,August,30
lights do not change,4,i have tryed many times to change the colors and they wont change. but the battery last for a good long time,22,5.0,2021,08,August,30
Keys,1,"Ok, so there is nothing ""wrong"" with this keyboard, but NOWHERE in the description did it say that it had a matte finish. The keys have a slightly sandpaper-y feel to them that I just cannot handle as a highly sensory sensitive person. Every time I touch a key it is like nails on a chalkboard. It was a great price, so I decided to use it as a keyboard for my TV (used very infrequently) instead of my primary computer keyboard, rather than return it. I am now shopping for an alternative primary keyboard to use.",97,4.0,2021,08,August,29
It’s pretty and light weight,5,Keyboard worked great for the longest time but ive had it for a bit over a year and now typing is progressively become more difficult due to the lost key presses. its got bad enough to affect games now so my player stops and takes stuttering steps before returning back to normal for a short while.,56,4.0,2021,08,August,29
Overall would recommend,3,The keys start to fade and you can't see the letters/numbers after repeated use.,14,5.0,2021,08,August,28
There is a tiny 'on' button on the bottom of the keyboard!,12,this keyboard has a short battery life and doesn't give any sort of indication that the battery is low till it stops working. then when you charge it it doesn't let you know when its done. it also doesn't seem to like any alt or windows key related shortcuts from the left side only the right,56,4.0,2021,08,August,27
Good overall,2,Product is fine but it's super limited to what it can do you are stuck with the rainbow colors for the lights which is not what the description sounds like so I would say this is nearly false advertisement based off of wording but it's probably translated through 3 levels of Google translate so who knows.Obviously is a membrane keyboard and it's very squishy. The lighting isn't bad and the only gamer thing about this is the RGB you can't control I would have rather had a completely red one.I am going to find another keyboard and return this one for its lack of functionality.,105,4.0,2021,08,August,27
Great product and excellent service,5,I had a slight issue and was sent a new keyboard with express shipping. Turned out the original keyboard worked after all. Great customer support.,25,5.0,2021,08,August,26
Battery running quickly,3,"Got this keyboard as a replacement for a previous wireless keyboard. I liked the multi colored backlight functionality, however what I do not like is that the lights turn off after about 10 seconds of no use. I wanted this keyboard to stay lit up but it just doesn’t do that. Still works and functions like a good keyboard I just hoped that the lights would stay on longer.",69,1.0,2021,08,August,25

Short Life,2,"I really like this keyboard, it’s great because it’s pretty and lightweight. I don’t like that the charger is so weird though it has a tendency to get loose. That’s the only thing I found wrong though.Don’t leave the power on I don’t think this has a sleep mode you’ll come back and this thing will be stone dead lol. I always shut this off when I’m done with it.",70,1.0,2021,08,August,23
Don’t bother,2,"Been looking for a good first wireless keyboard that won't break the bank and have been pretty satisfied. I've used this keyboard for 3 weeks and haven't had any issues. The keyboard itself is very lightweight, as for gaming I've had no issues across multiple games. A great starter wireless keyboard for the price!",54,5.0,2021,08,August,23
Charge lasts 2 days..very quiet though!,6,"OK, I tried everything in the world to get this keyboard to work:  plugged the dongal into the USB port, charged it up overnight, and finally restarted the computer.  I looked at the bottom of the keyboard and saw nothing!  But there is a very tiny button that blends in with the rest of the keyboard which is in the 'off' position when it first arrives.  TURN THE BUTTON ON!  This message is for people who haven't had to buy a new keyboard in a million years, like me...  Hope it helps all the non-techie people out there...  I love the colors on the keyboard, and because of my set-up, the keyboard is in a fairly dark area in a pull-out beneath the desk.  So this is really, really helpful.  Very light to the touch as advertised!  I'm not a gamer, but you don't have to be to appreciate this keyboard!",151,4.0,2021,08,August,22

After a week or two it died completely and i couldnt get it to charge, the light never came on i left it plugged in for over 12 hrs got maybe 30 mins of use out of it. Told seller and they replaced it with another really fast was happy with that. However same exact issue with the 2nd one it works perfectly for about two weeks used it for a whole day it has died completely another round of 8 hrs or more of charging. And it died after 10 mins.

sticky back space button,4,I love this keyboard so far. Awesome colors! Great ergonomics! Really good for gaming as well. My one complaint is the position of the enter key. Could be a little closer to the pinky. Other than that! This is the perfect keyboard!,42,4.0,2021,08,August,13

Customer support?,2,"I purchased this 6 months ago for work at home. I really like everything about the keyboard accept the letter quality.  As you can see by my picture,  within 6 months the letters have started to rub off. It has the backlight but it doesn't matter because it lights the key and not the letter so you don't know which key it is unless you have them memorized. Next time I would pay a bit more for double shot/ laser etched.",81,4.0,2021,08,August,11

"Solid, very cool looking keyboard",5,Love it I don’t use it for gaming but the keyboard is excellent I love the lights it has how it charges  usb c so that’s nice all around good key boardUPDATEI had to change my rating on this as it's now just broke. I trade stocks and crypto so I don't really  or use the keyboard in a gaming or super high type of way like other might that use it for gaming or such. But I was just using it as I normally to enter company's tickers to search around in the morning when it just turned off on me.  So ok I thought it was dead plugged it in no light of it charging so I turn it off let it sit for a couple mins so I turn it back on cause I just need to enter a couple letter real fast so I can check something it work n then turns back off so I switch it off again. Now I had to do that maybe about 3 times n now the turn off on switch is not moving back to the on position n nothing on the keyboard is working.  It's never fallen always been on my desk.

Alright,1,I purchased this keyboard in May and it's now July. I use this keyboard for gaming so I do use it quite a bit which is why I purchased it in the first place going off the reviews. I'm already having keys stick/not working which shouldn't be happening since I've only had it for less than 2 months 😑. It's worked great up until this last week but I guess I'm going to have to look into another keyboard now.,80,3.0,2021,07,July,18
Quality product,2,Excellent gaming keyboard. I purchased this for my grandson and he loves it. Takes gaming to a whole new level with his xbox.,23,5.0,2021,07,July,17
"Glicthy on low battery life, short charging cord",8,We love it! We can type in a dark room and it’s so pretty!,14,3.0,2021,07,July,17
Keyboard disconnects often,3,"Everything is precisely as advertised- which is what I needed for working from home. This keyboard was purchased to help keep me from slouching over my laptop key, which is smaller and doesn’t tilt up",35,1.0,2021,07,July,15
Great keyboard with good reception.,5,Very nice keyboard. Lots of color choices. Breathing speed can be adjusted from really slow to fast. Or you can choose to not breathe at all and keep a solid color. Well made. My only complaint is it shuts off after 60 seconds of non-use. But a simple touch of a button immediately turns it back on again. I contacted customer service for some questions regarding the lighting (nothing was wrong with the keyboard). Customer service was fantastic!! They responded to me immediately and answered all my questions. I would definitely recommend this keyboard.,94,5.0,2021,07,July,14
Very light will review after xmas,6,Great keyboard and even better Customer Service. Highly recommend,9,1.0,2021,07,July,13
Great wireless keyboard!,3,"The lettering on the kb is so faint you can't see them unless the backlit is on. Problem is you can't turn Auto-dim off which means you have to hit a key to wake it up. If you can't have it backlit when you reach for it when gaming, it's utterly useless in a dark room. Does it work for the price? Yes. Does it work for gaming? Nope, not at all.",72,5.0,2021,07,July,13
Key sensitivity is pretty bad,5,I use it for work as a 911 dispatcher. I work at night in a dark room so I love the colored lights! Great keyboard,25,3.0,2021,07,July,11

Works sometimes...,2,I like wireless keyboard,4,1.0,2021,07,July,10
Most likely good for young healthy eyes.,7,Keyboard works well. Charge only lasts a few days and I have not been able to use it while charging.  There is no warning to let you know the battery is about to die.  Keyboard just stops working while your typing,41,4.0,2021,07,July,10
Did not type,3,I love this. I like to work with dim lights in my office and this helps with my tasks. Charge lasts for a week or so.,26,1.0,2021,07,July,09
Stopped working after a month,5,"I bought when I started to play more mouse/keyboard games and didn't want to be tethered to the computer. It's pretty, has a nice height with the little feet, but is a little glitchy sometimes. It might be that the charge is running out, but it puts itself to sleep (the lights turn off and the keys don't register) in bursts and I have to switch back to my wired keyboard.  The only fix is to plug it into the computer with a cord that is shorter than my existing wired keyboard cord :/",94,1.0,2021,07,July,09
Better then I expected,4,"This keyboards has a decent design, however it disconnects very often. It's completely useless if I can't use it.",19,4.0,2021,07,July,08
Great Wireless Keyboard,3,"This keyboard works exactly as expected. Though it says it's a quite keyboard, its a fair amount louder than a silent keyboard like the Logitech one. The LED's are nice and able to adjust the brightness. I find this helpful because I work in a dark room at my PC. The dongle is able to connect easily and has good reception. The keystrokes are reliable and the keyboard well built with not completely smooth keys. I personally like the small amount of texture on the keys. The keyboard also goes to ""sleep"" after maybe a minute to save battery life. I charged it when I got it and have been using it for 6 days with heavy use 5 of those days. All in all, a solid keyboard for a reasonable price.",132,5.0,2021,07,July,07

Very quiet,2,It did not perform well for gaming the wireless connection was bad and it overall sucked,16,5.0,2021,06,June,19
Stay away!!,2,We needed a wireless keyboard quickly and this keyboard from KLIM could not be a better find! The colors are fun and the keyboard has full keys that are quiet and responsive.  It takes up less space than our old model and so far it has been working really well.  Make sure you take a look at the booklet that comes with the keyboard.  It's a fun read about the company and the people who founded it.,77,1.0,2021,07,July,06
Very disappointed,2,"Almost every time I type, the keyboard always misses a key press for some reason and I have to do it again. I don't know if it's the key sensitivity or something else but it's irritating.",36,1.0,2021,07,July,06
BEST keyboard purchase ever!,4,The keyboard is really nice but in the past weeks it doesn't pick up charge anymore. I tried different chargers and it doesn't work,24,5.0,2021,07,July,06

"Quiet key action, visible in the dark, decent battery life",10,"I like this keyboard because it is a huge  improvement over my old non-backlit unit. I do believe that there is alot of room for us older folks with sight problems. The back lighting would be much improved by making it all one color, either bright white or the bright green. Increasing the size of the letters, numbers and symbols would also help. The unit functiond well and it was easy to put into operation. It is very light weight and is not as flimsy as some others who have rated it have mentioned. It is a keyboard; not a hammer.",101,5.0,2021,07,July,04
Definitely NOT Silent,3,"It powers on and lights up well with every stroke..However-I wasn't able to get it to type, so I'm returning this keyboard.",22,2.0,2021,07,July,02

The best bang for the buck,6,Great quality for the price. RGB is nice and bright. Key sound isn’t too bad. Not great for games that need key sensitivity.,23,3.0,2021,06,June,29
Good Keyboard,2,"Bought this  December  27th (now July 6th) and at first it was amazing!! I downloaded the drivers and it worked flawlessly. Now, 7 months later the keys have slowly stopped working, it misses keys I push all the time and it has become a hassle even trying to game. When it misses the keys my backlight will go out. If I press harder, it does nothing, if I roll my finger around the key I am holding, it will start working for a little while. My keyboard and desktop do not sit in a dusty or dirty environment either and neither are abused as well as my current mouse. This is an extremely low quality product and you definitely get what you pay for. I'd do business elsewhere. They also no longer offer the drivers on the website.",138,5.0,2021,06,June,27
Does not work well with Xbox,6,"I was very excited about this keyboard, but unfortunately it has been a very bad experience. In general it is as presented in the advertisement, but after using it for 5 minutes it stops working completely even when it is turned on. I tried reinstalling the drivers, changing the USB port and trying it with another computer, but did not get good results, it does not work after a few minutes.I am very disappointed that I wasted my money on this product.",82,2.0,2021,06,June,26
Great for Gaming!!!,3,"Y'all... Now I know that I haven't had this keyboard long at all (2-3 weeks), but it is a game changer. The sound of the keys isn't too loud, but it's not so soft that you feel unproductive! I love the way that the keys actually feel when I am typing. The color of the keyboard is great too. I would purchase this keyboard at full price all over again if I had to! #primeday",75,5.0,2021,06,June,25
Fancy Keyboard,2,"Only downside to this keyboard is that the enter key is too damn small, I keep on pressing ""/"", but other then that keyboard is fine",26,5.0,2021,06,June,25
STOPPED WORKING AFTER A DAY,5,I wasn't looking for an ultra gamer keyboard with the lowest latency and most responsiveness / highest keystrokes per minute possible. I was just looking for something I could see in low lighting at night and take with me to the couch to control the TV monitor with. This did the job perfectly. Battery seems to last about 30 hours on my count with the setting of full lighting every keystroke. Would recommend.,73,1.0,2021,06,June,25

Amazing support,2,"Pros _ the price, sleek design, wireless, easy plug and play.Cons _ space bar is extremely wobbly for claiming this to be ""silent"". The other keys are satisfactory to say the most in relevance to ""silent"" keys. Additionally the lights come on only if it's being used which isn't much of a con.",53,5.0,2021,06,June,23
Mine was defective,3,"Keys are quite but not silent, responsive and not too firm. Lights look good (there is no light animation) and battery life is well so far thanks to the 1 minute no-use sleep mode that will turn off the lights to save battery. Overall a good wireless keyboard!",48,1.0,2021,06,June,23
More for a low price,5,"Charged it up and hooked it up to Xbox One.  Often missed key strokes, and duplicated key strokes.  Tried on a computer and seemed to work ok.",27,5.0,2021,06,June,23
Charge life,2,Great for gaming and extremely satisfying to type on!!! The sleep mode comes on fast after 2 minutes of not using it and will immediately turn on once you start using it again. Definitely worth my money and the quality is  phenomenal!,42,2.0,2021,06,June,23

Best Keyboard ever.,3,Very short charge life also keyboard was hard to use,10,5.0,2021,06,June,15
Fabulous,1,"This is a good rechargeable keyboard that holds a charge for a long time. You can still use the keyboard when it is plugged into a USB port for charging. Placement of keys is taking some getting used to, in particular the enter key. As a touch typist I find myself hitting wrong keys when I should be connecting with the enter key. Frustrating",64,5.0,2021,06,June,15
They take care of their customers,6,"It's an awesome keyboard for any budget build ,rgb lights are great comes with different modes for the lights ,it's quiet and they have amazing customer support !",28,4.0,2021,06,June,15
Excellent keyboard.,2,"Ive had this about a year, the key board worked great...if the receiver is infront of my pc...(my keyboard is only ever 2-3 ft away. it has  slowly come to thiscurrently a foot and a half away and i have to pick it up to type while it's plugged in to bring it closer.""ths sna sewt rendem""is what was received while trying to say "" this is only a somewhat recent development""",72,5.0,2021,06,June,15
Love it,2,"The keyboard is quiet and the backlight is really nice. The keyboard is functioning correctly, as I am typing the review right now. However the design itself has some problems.If I were to describe the feeling of typing on it, it feels somewhat sticky, as though I am typing into quicksand. This is likely because for the design to be quiet, it blunts the speed of key pressing and returning to its original position. Honestly wouldn't have minded the noise if it meant a better typing experience, as it feels like I'm actually expending effort to type. each. key.The charger port also has issues with the male USB-C cable plugging in. It has lots of resistance and only goes in like 2 mm with exposed metal when the charge is active.All in all, I think the keyboard is nice and the bluetooth feature is a godsend, but the quality is pushing the envelope in satisfaction.",155,5.0,2021,06,June,15

Functions as described.,3,"Great keyboard! Connects quickly to PC, and the battery last a decent amount of time. The only thing I wish it had that it doesn’t would be that the light constantly stays on, but unfortunately it does not. Not a big deal though. The first keyboard they sent to me was not registering every key I pressed, but it was never specific to any specific keys. I contacted customer support regarding the issue and after having me run a few tests, they determined the keyboard was defective and sent me a new one within two days! Great company",98,5.0,2021,06,June,10
Love the lights and non flat keys!,7,This keyboard is easy on the eyes and very responsive; you can also drop it and spill water on it and it just keeps on ticking.,26,5.0,2021,06,June,10
Great!!,1,I love this keyboard,4,5.0,2021,06,June,09
Great looking gift,3,"Alright. I purchased this product about 2 years ago and it has gotten regular use. Over all, for what it is, it is a good product for a good price.I do wish there was an option to dim or turn off the LED lights when using the keyboard but that's a fairly small issue.My one frustration is this: There is no place on the keyboard to store the wireless dongle. The slot it comes packaged in is just a rectangular hole in the back of the board with tape over it. Once it is unpackaged and getting used regularly, not having a place to lock the dongle in to the keyboard when transporting it creates a risk of losing the tiny little BT dongle...which is exactly what happened to me when I moved my home office.So I was without use of this keyboard for about 2 weeks.The good news is that when I contacted KLIM they were happy to mail out a new dongle free of charge. In fact, the first one they sent got lost in the mail so they happily sent a second replacement free as well (and tracked the package this time).So. The product is middle of the road and could use some engineering improvements but it's worth the money.And more importantly the customer service is 5-star.",220,5.0,2021,06,June,09

Nothing special,2,"UPDATE: 129 days later and the receiver has started to experience an internal fault. It is loosing connection with my pc, and acting as if I removed the receiver from the USB port. Windows is even playing disconnected chime. Moving to a new port does not fix the problem. It uses windows drivers, so there's no update. It seems to have started about a week after the last version update. I am running windows 10 version 21H1. Maybe it needs a firmware update? Also if you go to the website listed for support in the US. They don't have any electronics on the site. Only outdoor gear. Confusing!! Plus it's NOT 24/7 support. They are only open 8-5 mst.Pros: I will start by saying that I appreciate that the charging port is C type. That makes it easier to charge given that most pc electronics are going that way. The battery lasts about a week between charges for me, with about 2 hours of use per day. It's also a lot more responsive than my old wireless logi**ch keyboard. Like I noticed a difference in rocket league immediately! Backlight is ok. I have it set to solid and med bright.Cons: It's not TRUE RGB backlight. There are only 2 options for color on the lighting. Wave or solid on. It's just different color LEDs in the backlight.The keyboard layout is also different from my old keyboard. The enter key is tall instead of double key width. So when I type, I end up hitting the ' key instead of enter. And when you're in a game, short on time. You don't need missed keys.If you want an RGB keyboard. This is not the one you want.If you want a responsive wireless keyboard with multicolor backlight. This might be the one for you.",302,1.0,2021,06,June,05
Broke after 4 months.,4,Feels very light weight and doesn't sit tight.  If you touch type you will most likely find this unsuitable for daily fast moving entry.,24,1.0,2021,06,June,03
Stopped working after a couple months,6,"It is a very nice keyboard. The feel is soft yet mechanical. Battery charge time seems sufficient. And the rgb is a perfect brightness-and at 40$ I did not expect any color/brightness control so that is sufficient in my eyes as well.It needs a better feeling charging port. it does not feel like it connects or goes in all the way. The cord is a severe charging restriction. in other words, if you use it to charge a phone, the phone will charge in slow charge mode.  but maybe it is on purpose to keep the batteries from overheating? I suggest making sure to use only that cord for it.  The keys are a little ""squishy"" for extended use. But over time and use I suspect that will wear away and leave a light feeling touch which will be decent for gaming and typing.",144,1.0,2021,06,June,03

Bad for gaming,3,I love my new keyboard! I love that the keys are not flat. The best part is they light up! It makes typing so much easier! Those that complain about the space bar being loud it isn't if you hit it in the middle. I have had no issues and my typing is way better than the flat one I was using. It is very comfortable to type and doesn't take up a lot of space. Perfect!,77,1.0,2021,05,May,23

My computer wasn't built when I initially bought it but It was functional, at least with my laptop but soon as I was ready to use it on my desktop it won't work for anything. The only reason I am giving this more than a star is the seller at least tried and replaced this receiver when I thought that was the problem but unfortunately, this is a cheaply made keyboard and basically, you get what you pay for.

KLIM Chroma Rechargeable Wireless Gaming Keyboard,6,"I wasn't looking to spend the amount of money I did one this unit, but I'm really glad I did. Even though it's not the most ergonomic keyboard, it serves its purpose and does exactly what I need it to do. Not to mention that the lights (which light up the letters very well) make it easier to find some of the lesser known and used keys. Plus it uses the same USB C charger that everything else uses.

Great,1,"This KLIM would likely be an incredible gamer's keyboard - which is what it's made for.It's sturdy & has a cool multi-colored backlight. So as long as you're young and/or can type without looking at the keys, you'll probably love it!I wanted a backlit bluetooth keyboard for my laptop, but the KLIM's multicolor backlighting made the keys appear inconsistent, and so were difficult to read (the top characters of some keys didn't light up as well as the bottom ones on the same key).  And I found  the different colors simultaneously left to right across the board added a 'variability' to the characters that impacted their legibility for me.I ended up keeping a seenda, much thinner and flatter, w adjustable backlighting in a choice of several colors - but only one at a time, so the keys were consistently bright, sharp and clear.",143,5.0,2021,04,April,23

Very satisfied,2,Not sure why but this keyboard worked fine for about 10 months and then POOF - no more.  Just wouldn't connect to my Windows PC at all.

Because I look at the keyboard when I type I find out after  a minute or so of typing I look up and find over a third of what I typed is full of missed letters, entire words are missing, parts of words are run together.  The keyboard just doesn't register all of my keystrokes. I have even tried slowing down and being even more deliberate about my touches on the keystrokes. Same result.

Lasted less than a year!,5,"It's just okay for me. It isn't so quiet that I would recommend it for a quiet office, but it's quieter than standard keyboards. The lighting effects are alright, but they go to sleep after only a few seconds and there's no way to modify that. There's also no way to see the remaining battery power that I've found yet. It was easy to setup, but it's worth noting that plugging the keyboard in with the charging cable doesn't actually connect it to the PC, so you still have to have the wireless receiver plugged in, taking up an additional USB slot. Overall the keyboard just doesn't impress me. I've got a half dozen other boards I've tried and I I'll probably try a steel-framed, ""quiet,"" mechanical keyboard next.",129,2.0,2021,04,April,07
Great,1,"I picked this keyboard since it's one of the few out there that still have the old school design with a big tall Enter button instead of the wide one. I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice typing feels and how quiet it is. These were the main requirements I had and I'm happy to say it ticks all boxes.I only wished it operated with replaceable batteries as those tend to last longer in my experience. Instead it has you charging the built in battery with a cable, which lasts about 2 weeks before needing to recharge it. But that was my fault for not paying attention to the description. Other than that, I noticed the space key is slightly louder than the rest of the keys, but really this is just nit-picking and not noticeable when typing normally.Overall, really very happy with my purchase.",146,5.0,2021,04,April,05

The backlight stays rainbow colored and will turn on after a few seconds of non-use which makes it difficult to use it in the dark.

Good,1,"If you want a great keyboard without the high price then this it. It is quiet unless you pound the keys. I don't know how long the charge last as I charge it at night. The keyboard is spill proof. I spilled coffee on it and after drying all night it was working great again. The seller was quick to respond to email about it not working after spilling and told what to do, which I had already done. They stated they would stand by warranty but didn't need it. As for adjusting the lightening, I haven't tried as I like it as it is. I would recommend buy a wrist support for keyboard. I got one for about $11 that included one for keyboard and mouse on Amazon.",129,5.0,2021,03,March,22

Misses lots of keystrokes,4,Not worth the money at all. It’s just a standard keyboard that slides all over the place and occasionally lights up.

Worth the buy for sure,5,"When I first got this keyboard, I noticed that my passwords were often wrong, though I knew I had typed them correctly.  Missing keys started showing in browsers and and applications, alike.  There was no rhyme or reason to it.  About 1 of 25 key strokes just didn't appear.  Sometimes, angrily pressing the same key 3 or 4 times in a row produced no result.I thought that it might be low battery, without the warning light.  Even when I left the USB cable plugged in all the time, performance did not improve.  If you use this keyboard for gaming, you will suffer lots of premature death.  If you use it for work, you will suffer crippling frustration.  I am using mine as a paper-weight, having switched back to an old Dell keyboard that came with my tower PC 10 years ago.The battery life did not impress, even with the brightness somewhat muted.The tactile feedback is poor, too.  It just always had an un-satisfying feel.",164,5.0,2021,03,March,15

Battery dies way too often,5,This keyboard is great for gaming but when I got this It came with 1 downside is that my space bar was squeaky not too loud but definitely noticeable but later down the road with the keyboard it’s just a recommendation to the product is at a red light for the battery light so you can tell if it is low cause I could be gaming and it does with no sort of warning but overall great product it works amazing,81,2.0,2021,03,March,05

"Full size, ergonomic, and long battery life.",7,"Seriously the worst keyboard I've used in 25 years of pc gaming. INCLUDING novelty keyboards, micro keyboards that fit in one hand, keyboards from the 90's with the pin conectors. This keyboard shuts off and disconnects from the dongle often and repeatedly.

I though that by putting a couple more dollars in than the minimum I could avoid products like this but I am DISGUSTED with the product quality here. I would return this product if I didn't intend to SMASH it with a hammer when I but an upgrade this week, in a sick attempt to reach some sort of closure on how AWFUL this products is.

mediocre,1,The back light is very nice! Some of the top keys don't have the clearest numbering/lettering but if you know where the keys are this is very minor. I wish the back light had an adjustable sleep timer. One charge lasts a long time and you can still use the keyboard while it's plugged in for charging.

"Nice keyboard, but the backlit features are sorely lacking",9,"Ive been looking for a nice keyboard for my custom built gaming/school/home use pc and I am more than pleased with this keyboard. Input lag is comparable to my logitech wired keyboard, and ive played Titanfall 2 with it, and I love it. Battery life seems great, as ive used this product all night and its still going strong. The keys are great, not quite as ratifying as a clicky mechanical keyboard, but very close. The backlighting is beautiful. The colors are clear and sharp but not overwhelmingly bright. The shape, key travel, and spacing make this keyboard an absolute pleasure to work/play with. Its lightweight, but sturdy, as you would actually have to put alot of force into bending or twisting the board to hurt it. Personally im certain that it would take ALOT of high drops onto concrete to actually hurt this thing. All in all, great product for a great price, and i stoked to have it, Ive actually typed this review with the keyboard!",168,4.0,2021,02,February,22
Love it,2," The keyboard is nice and quiet and feels great to type on. The achilles heel is the space bar. Arguably the most used key on the board produces a cacophonous ""SMACK"" upon use.

Just as expected.,3,"I do like the pretty lights and how you can easily use this keyboard in a dark room. OTOH, those pretty lights burn the batteries quite quickly, so it isn't really a wireless keyboard; it's best to keep it plugged in and charging most of the time. But that's true of basically all wireless lighted keyboards. The big problem I had was that it just never got along with my computer, a Mac running Big Sur. Several times a day I would have to unplug the wireless dongle, shut off the keyboard, and then plug in and power up again. Even then I sometimes had to restart the computer. After a week or so of that I gave up and returned the keyboard.",123,5.0,2021,02,February,20

I just bought another KLIM keyboard for work.",54,1.0,2021,02,February,17
Fast cool keyboard,3,"I wanted to get a wireless, backlit keyboard for my home PC, something I could use throughout my office without having to be directly next to my computer. This keyboard looks great, the keys themselves have nice travel for easy typing, and the charge lasts for a very long period of time, but the lack of an ""always on"" feature for the backlit is very annoying. I understand it always being on would kill the battery quickly, but this is a rechargeable keyboard, so losing some time to have to charge isn't a big deal. For me, it just feels odd that they wouldn't just add an always on function for those who would want that. I'm often reviewing other peoples work, or just reading through instructions, so I often don't type for 60 seconds at a time, so the lights are constantly going off. Again, I understand the reason, and it's not a huge problem, but it just feels like it would have been so easy to have an always on function added. Overall, good keyboard, but unfortunately for me it's just not a good fit for how I use my keyboard.",193,5.0,2021,02,February,16

Keyboard 10 out of 10,5,"There are multiple times the keyboard does not register my keystrokes, causing typos in word-processing and issues when gaming. Defeats the purpose of having a keyboard IMO. It looks nice though...",31,5.0,2021,02,February,14
Cool cool,2,After maybe three months of use I started experiencing issues with it staying powered on and connecting to my PC. I would try typing and the keys simply wouldn’t work and would keep turning off. Overall my experience with this keyboard has been very poor and I don’t recommend it.,50,5.0,2021,02,February,14
Terrible Stopped Working within weeks,5,"The keys are very soft when hitting which makes for a nice feel to a keyboard. I like that the sleep mode kicks in after a minute or so of no use, translating to a longer battery life before having to plug in and charge. The color does only stay at one spot, it doesn't breathe or anything. I Will update in couple of weeks if needed.",67,1.0,2021,02,February,14
Works as advertised,3,"The ""G"" and ""H"" keys, sometimes the ""Z"" key and the ""ENTER"" key just stopped working TWO MONTHS after I bought this thing. I never leave reviews. But this is truly unacceptable. Do not buy, PERIOD.",36,5.0,2021,02,February,13
BEST Customer Service!,3,"This keyboards look nice and lighted up from the outside but when it comes to using it, it is very unreliable and will stop working on you unexpectedly. I bought this back in early Decemebr 2020. I soon I got it it was not connecting to my laptops.I made sure keyboard was fully charged and ready to go, and tested it on two different laptops and nothing. I reached out to their IT/customer service and said the dongle has stopped working and would send me another one in 10days. I had to wait 10days! for a replacement, mind you I am working from home and really giving this keyboard a chance. Dongle came, followed the intructions and reset the keyboard and it worked! This was by end of December. Its February 17 and it stopped working today! So far it lasted a little over a month before having the same issue all over again. This is a huge waste of time especially when having to work from home and having to stop and try to reset and test with multiple computers and still nothing. This time it can't be the dongle, when inserted it reads int he computer. I do not recommend!!!",202,5.0,2021,02,February,12
Weird buzz when lights are on,6,"When I received product I knew it was what I wanted.Nice raised keys, nice crisp click.  THEN (of course) after throwing awaythe box and packaging and really getting down to using it, irealized the CAP N key does not work!  URGH.  My mistake for sure.MAKE SURE YOU USE IT FOR A WHILE BEFORE DISCARDING ANYTHING!!!",55,1.0,2021,02,February,11
You get what you pay for,6,There is an input delay. When you press a key it takes a half-second to actually register which can make a huge difference in professional gaming.,26,1.0,2021,02,February,11
Rechargeable,1,"I absolutely love this keyboard! I normally get just the regular wireless or plug-in but never again. I can type so much faster on this keyboard. It responds beautifully. Fewer typos, even, because it keeps up with me. And the cool lighting is a pleasing bonus!",46,4.0,2021,02,February,09
Dim leds and short battery life,6,"So it's possible this is a good device. However, the keyboard/receiver combo I received is triple-malfunctioning: it lags excessively between input and recognition (tried all 6 USB ports to confirm), the sleep mode activates within seconds of disuse so even input tests are wonky, and receiving range is maybe 2ft at best.",52,3.0,2021,02,February,09
Backlight no bright enough to light up #'s and Letters,10,Grandson loved it for gaming.,5,4.0,2021,02,February,09
It was kinda good,4," This Keyboard is nice for the money. The colors are very cool and the keys are really quiet, however, the space bar is audibly loud when pressed and I find it distracting. Also they they have configured the return key different and put the back-slash key before the return key which has made the stretch harder. So every time I try and hit the RETURN key, I am hitting the forward- slash key., also very irritating. Normally that back-slash key is above the return key. I have attached video's and pictures of what I am talking about. I am not sure if I will keep it or not!",108,3.0,2021,02,February,09

It’s ok,2,"Wow, what a great keyboard that makes typing fun.  Keys are well spaced - if you use shortcuts frequently, this will really help!  Does not feel cheap at all...the construction is top-notch and the key sound is an elegant ""clicky-pump"" sound.  As far as I can tell, RGB color pattern is the only color choice but many ways to tune the back-lighting effect to your taste.  Super happy with the purchase.",71,3.0,2021,02,February,09
Good keyboard especially for gaming.,5,Best keyboard for gaming. Works with Xbox consoles and PlayStation consoles as well. Battery life is amazing only charged it twice since and I only had it for 2 months. 10 out of 10,34,5.0,2021,02,February,09
Great and comfortable keyboard,4,"Good for my wireless gaming setup. Needed ergonomic rests to use it though. But it is a good keyboard with good rgb lights but I do wish sometimes that the lights stayed on. Hard to see the keys in my dark room sometimes when I get ready to use it, gotta click the wrong key to turn it back on to see which is right. But other than that, good response time, battery life and all. Would recommend",78,5.0,2021,02,February,09
After 2 months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters,12,Terrible stopped working within weeks. The keys have weak feedback & awkward placement of the enter key. Not to mention the weird noises the keyboard makes when the lights are on.,31,1.0,2021,02,February,08

Dope keyboard,2,"Someone in my family asked for this product for a Christmas gift, so, after reading the great reviews, I bought it. She used it for one week, and it needed charged. After that, it wouldn't hold a charge for more than 10 minutes. After she told me this, I contacted the seller. They immediately responded and offered to send me another one if I was willing to send back the defective one. I am completely convinced that the one I received just had a defect. They were so easy to work with, and the replacement works perfectly.",97,5.0,2021,02,February,08
This is an amazing product.,5,"The keyboard when it lights up makes a strange high pitched buzz. Hearing that none stop would definitely cause a headache.

Good quality great value.,4,Falls asleep entirely to quickly.  Midtyping and the keyboard is asleep.

So cool,2,"I just recently got into using a mouse and keyboard for FPS games such as COD and this is my first keyboard. Overall good keyboard, keys are firm but press easy, some buttons are shaped different than usual but that makes it easier to use them, ie. The enter button. Sweet color display. Goes into sleep mode after about 2 minutes of not use to conserve battery but shoots right on as soon as you hit a button. Over good keyboard. Works with XBOX ONE",85,5.0,2021,02,February,05
Wish it was better,4,"Only wish is that it had a battery meter, but it's otherwise a great purchase",15,2.0,2021,02,February,05
Worst keyboard ever,3,After 2 months it started missing key stokes or double entering letters. You would think it would last longer than 2 months before having issues like this. It is hard to respond quickly to things when you have to keep going back to correct words that are either missing letter or have too many letters. Quite disappointing. Time to find a new keyboard.,63,1.0,2021,02,February,05
Awesome awesome,2,"The Enter key is weirdly shaped, the back lights do not stay on unless i am typing and the F6 key sticks.  I use for work not gaming.  It is too much trouble to return but I will not buy again.",41,5.0,2021,02,February,05

Stuck and noisy keys,4,"I love the product, but I love the customer service even more.

The are all truly amazing, even sent me candy after a few weeks of putting up with me and assisting me with my wireless light up keyboard.",65,1.0,2021,02,February,04
Great keyboard,2,"For starters,  the box came cut up, I dont know the reason anyone would have to cut pff a part of the product box, maybe im being paranoid, i dont know.  Also, as you can see on the pictures, the keyboard was totally dirty with dust, stains,  some minor scratches here and there, and what seems to be food crumbs under keys. Leads me to think this was being used already by seller previous to selling as brand new. Lights look cool amd it conmects fine to my Laptop, but the lack of hygiene is what got to me.  Dont buy!",101,5.0,2021,02,February,03
Soft Keys,2,"I bought this keyboard because it seemed like a deal with the backlit and ""silent key"" features.  I found the backlit features to be almost irrelevant when using in the dark because the alternating and dark colors made it difficult to see.  I put ""silent keys"" in quotation marks because they're not really silent.  The keys felt no different than a basic keyboard that you can buy for $20-25.  If you're looking for good quality and can spend $15 more I suggest a Logitech.  That's why I immediately unhooked it and returned it so I can go back to buying the Logitech K800.",103,3.0,2021,02,February,03

enjoy the keyboard,3,I have only had this a few days but so far is been good.  Haven’t had any connectivity issues.

But came to realize if I type to quickly the keyboard my miss the key letter you put in. It kept happening then I got my wireless work one and realize I don’t miss a beat. The klim keyboard I have seems to not be able to read at a fat pace when typing. That comes to me as a big issue.,73,5.0,2021,02,February,01

Calidad,1,"Honestly, the soft push of the keys feel weird. Maybe because I'm used to a laptop keyboard with very shallow keys and friends boards with more ""clicky"" keys.

Best Keyboard Ever!,3,"There is just so much to dislike about this keyboard now that I have used it for awhile. First, there is no indication of battery status. Second, the on time before the lights turn off when inactive is too brief and not adjustable. Third, the battery life is very short, so it's easiest just to leave it plugged in, which defeats the purpose. Fourth, the action keys for sound don't connect to the computer and are therefore worthless. Fifth, it is obnoxious that there is a little divot in the enter key and the | \ key is tucked in there--it is far too easy to hit the backslash when you think you are hitting enter. Sixth, it is cheaply made and feels flimsy. I am ordering from someone else and will gladly dump this one in the trash.",139,5.0,2021,01,January,29

Exactly what I was looking for!,6,"Likes - Works good for the price and is pretty good for a membrane keyboard. The battery seems to last quite a long time (didn't actually time it). The keyboard goes to sleep pretty fast to conserve battery life (also can be a con)Cons - This is why it is cheap so the cons are to be expected for a keyboard at this price point.1. The keyboard flexes2. The RGB is very limited, would of liked an option for a solid color.3. The keyboard shuts off even when plugged in (probably the biggest downside).4. The space bar is ""clacky"" and doesn't feel as solid as the other keys.If you want a decent keyboard that is fairly cheap and works as advertised this isn't a bad buy.",126,4.0,2021,01,January,25
Excellent!!,1,I work at a place that supplies cheap basic keyboards and I splurged to make my workday better with something that makes me happy. ‘How did they let you order that/mine is crap etc.’ I bought it with my own money to make me smile with the rainbow at my finger tips! Muhaha love it!!,55,5.0,2021,01,January,25
The key board is great,5,"I've been pc gaming since the 90s. I'm not sure what makes this a gaming keyboard. There aren't any special keys for hot binding. The back lit keys look cool, but are completely useless if you know how to type. I'll keep my opinion on pc gamers who don't know the keyboard layout to myself 😉So far I haven't had an issue with key lag or battery life, but I just got it this week. I did make sure it was fully charged before I used it.Otherwise, it's just a basic wireless keyboard. It's not fancy, or special.

Love the color scheme of the LED lights, can even see some of the LED lights like mixing with each other which I just find totally cool. The fact that this keyboard is wireless is just a plus for me. It is for sure not too overly clicky like other keyboards I had in the past, this one is more subtle but as well excellent to the touch. I guarantee your satisfaction with this keyboard and without a doubt recommend it to anyone wanting a new keyboard that is wireless or that is purchasing for the first time.",124,2.0,2021,01,January,23
Great,1,"Very reactive, but not quite ""membrane"" and NOT as quiet as they claim. Took a minute to get used to how loud the space bar especially was. But LOVE the colors and how quick it wakes/sleeps. Holds a long charge and recharges quickly. I have carpal tunnels and this is easier on my hands than even my macbook air! Ergonomic and reactive!Granted, its not ""wake the family"" loud or anything, but far from silent. My favorite keyboard ever nevertheless.",79,5.0,2021,01,January,23

did not hold charge,4,"I will be returning this. Overall, it's fine, but isn't what I need. If you aren't a fast typer, and don't use the ctrl+c and other functions like it, it will be good for you.There is a lag in the keys, and I frequently have to retype words because it misses letters as I type. It also has to be in direct ""sight"" of the usb, otherwise it doesn't work. The ctrl+c and other functions like it do not work, and I use these frequently. They also for some reason redesigned the keyboard so the backslash is where the enter key usually is, and the enter key is farther away. I have small hands as it is, so I cannot reach the enter key without picking up my hand which in inconvenient when I'm doing things like typing an essay. Finally, more of an aesthetic thing than anything, I do not like that the backlighting turns off without use. The colors are pretty, but I want them to stay on so I can still see the keyboard. I could understand it turning off after something like five or ten minutes of inactivity, but it turns off after a few seconds.I liked the idea of this keyboard, but it just won't work for me. It's lightweight, the colors are nice, the clack of the keys is the perfect volume, and I like that it has a battery light. But there are too many cons for me to keep it.",248,3.0,2021,01,January,16

"Nice, squeaky sometimes tho",4,"This is a good, quiet keyboard.I bought it because my wife and I share one living room, which is also where I write on my laptop.  Keyboard noise was driving her nuts.  Bought this wireless keyboard because it was advertised as quiet.  It really is quieter.  I made it even less noisy by putting a piece of towel under it.  That has really helped my marriage survive during the pandemic, cooped up together.The keyboard lighting is nice.  I prefer a lighted keyboard since I sometimes wake up, can't sleep, and start writing another chapter for a book that may someday be a bestseller.The keyboard charged up easily with the short USB cord (included).  The charge usually lasted one to two weeks between charging, even when I forgot to use the switch underneath to turn it off for the night.  When the battery died, the keyboard was instantly usable again as soon as I plugged it into the laptop.I have just one small grumble.  I'm a writer, not a gamer.  When I'm typing fast, I want a large ENTER button.  On this keyboard it is a little smaller in order to make room for a backslash key.  I find myself getting a lot of backslashes instead of new paragraphs.  This happened with a different keyboard a few years ago, which I threw away due to aggravation.  For this quiet keyboard, however, the configuration is not so aggravating.  For now, its quietness is terrific.Other than the extra backslash key, the keyboard action is NICE.  Feels great.  I can write for hours (when not interrupted by my dog).I hope this is helpful for someone.  Be well.",273,4.0,2021,01,January,13
Stopped working in less than a month,7,Well It was good while it lasted for a year but I will never buy an off brand wireless gaming keyboard again. Battery sucks on this keyboard.  I had to charge it at least once a week. It was so annoying that I just left the cable on the keyboard which defy the purpose of getting a wireless keyboard.  Then the keyboard would start having weird behavior.  It would freeze up or if I type it would get stuck on a letter and repeat it 30 times.  I'm so done with this junk.  FYI: I rarely used this keyboard for gaming.  I only use it for everything web surfing.  I need the illuminated light cause my work space is dark.,120,1.0,2021,01,January,13
great product must have for any laptop,7,Worked for a very few days then crapped out all together. My bad for buying a ‘bargain’ keyboard. I’ll stick with Logitech from now on.,25,5.0,2021,01,January,13
Too Light,2,"nice packaging counts for little when the instruction manual tells you nothing about how to use it. I had to go to youtube! also for touch typists, you may find it too soft/quiet. returned",34,1.0,2021,01,January,12
No “B” key,3,"The key board has very cheap construction. It has a major hardware flaw where ctrl+shift keyboard combinations do not function properly from the left side of the keyboard. It is much smaller than my previous Logitech wireless keyboard that broke. The cord it comes with is way too short, so I had to spend another $10 buying a longer cord. The RGB lighting effects are very sub par. They don’t stay on continuously and only have one alternate effect of breathing, otherwise the color effect is stationary and never moves. The keyboard is so light if wants to slide when using it, so you might also have to buy a keyboard pad. Next time, I think I’ll spend and extra $40 for a better ergonomic quality gaming keyboard.",128,1.0,2021,01,January,11
Best keyboard on market!,4,this keyboard is the best keyboard i ever owned. my gaming have been better with it. if you want own a keyboard KLIM is the best.,26,5.0,2021,01,January,11
positive tilt built in,4,"I don't do gaming, I really just wanted a lighted keyboard I could use with my home theater setup.  This one does the job.  But after six months the on/off switch developed a problem so I contacted the company about the issue.  They responded really fast, and bent over backward to supply me with a satisfactory solution.  Super nice folks, too.  Recommended.",62,2.0,2021,01,January,11
Feels great 👍,3,"Great keyboard, easy to use in the dark, But I wish it has a screen light option to turn down or up the screen brightness, but it just has the brightness of the keyboard :/The battery last like 4-5 days, no indicator to tell you it's dying, it just shuts off :(but it does tell you its charging yay :PGot to get used to the Ergonomic, like all things.",69,4.0,2021,01,January,06

Decent,1,"Looks great!  Feels great!  Unfortunately, doesn't completely work.  While some keyboard shortcuts work, many are missing.  The biggest omission for me, was ""CTRL + S"".  Who doesn't use the save shortcut?!  I literally use it every few minutes as I'm working.  I checked the reviews before purchasing and chalked it up to user error, but nope, you literally can't use the save shortcut.  That's a dealbreaker for me.  I do not recommend this keyboard if efficiency is your thing.",79,3.0,2021,01,January,05

Very Quiet,2,"The keyboard looked okay at first. I was a little sad that the rgb was not dynamic, but I thought I could live with that. Then I realized there was a major flaw when trying to do anything with it. There is literally no “B” key on the keyboard. I couldn’t even type this review on this keyboard or type the word “Keyboard”.",63,5.0,2021,01,January,02
Good quality,2,I spend 10-16 hrs on the computer a day for work and gaming. This is the best keyboard on the market.Not only that my Windows key stopped working. I tried troubleshooting but I thought it was broke. I opened up a support case with KLIM support and within the hour they replied with a thorough set of troubleshooting ideas.  Turns on there is a Windows key lock that my 3 year old little guy turned on.AMAZING SUPPORT! I'll only be buying KLIM products moving forward.,85,5.0,2020,12,December,31

Nice gaming keyboard,3,Lights up well and feels great on your fingers. Lost a star for not being able to have the lights constantly on. Always goes to sleep and just a little inconvenience when the keys are black 😅,37,5.0,2020,12,December,31

Good product,2,"My grandson loves this, he says it works great. He is a gamer, so he loves the lights and feel of the keys I’m told, great price, value, gift",29,5.0,2020,12,December,30
Great price for a functioning wireless keyboard.,7,while typing a high pitch humming comes from the charging port area that only goes away when the keyboard goes to sleep. other than that the keyboard spacebar after long extensive typing starts to wear off and the spring becomes more audible.,42,5.0,2020,12,December,29
"Not Silent, NO Adjustable Colors",5,"This keyboard is nice and works perfectly. The only thing I don't like about it is that you don't have the option to keep the lighting on. Especially at night or playing games I end up fiddling around finding out where I am on the keyboard. I will keep it for a backup, but I think I will be looking for something with more lighting options.",66,2.0,2020,12,December,28

Lacks range...,2,after a month it started to double type and miss keystrokes.,11,2.0,2020,12,December,27
It’s wireless.,2,"I love this keyboard. I love that it’s wireless. It came charged so I plugged it into my child’s computer and they were able to use it right away. I love that it’s fairly quiet typing. The backlight goes off quickly which I think is good because it saves battery. The one thing I personally don’t like is the placement of the “return” key and the “backslash” key. I’m used to the “backslash” key being above the “return” and the “return” key being more horizontal. Super small detail that is taking time for me to get used to, but I would still recommend this keyboard because it’s great overall.",109,5.0,2020,12,December,27

Awesome keyboard,2,"Received as a gift and wanted to love it, but the hot keys issue is real. The ctrl and shift keys on the left side cannot be used together.

Two out of four receiver stopped working.,7,"Works great - no issues with my unit.Power button feels a bit flimsy, saw other reviewers complaining about it breaking and I could see that happening. I am careful with mine and don't use it frequently.Can't change the color away from ""rainbow"" but you can alter the effect slightly. I didn't get this for robust color features so this doesn't bother me.The keys are a bit less diverted and less resistant  then what I'm used to - I frequently hit multiple keys while attempting to push one. Might bother another with sloppy hands like mine but I look at it like a challenge.Now that all being said! This is hands down a great option for wireless gaming. There are slightly cheaper keyboards that tout these specs but they seem to be either too cheaply made or have to many reported issues for me to expect a quality product. On this note, this keyboard is rechargeable! There are other, cheaper brands with similar products but they are mostly battery operated + other issues. In fact, I bought a $20 keyboard, here on amazon, that was similar, no lights, and used batteries - it didn't work upon arrival. This was my second purchase).I got this for gaming wirelessly and use it with additonal 2.4ghz receivers - no issues.  I haven't noticed any input delay but I sit pretty close to the receiver so distance isn't something I have stress tested.Currently this is the keyboard I would recommend for wireless gaming under $60.",250,4.0,2020,12,December,24
Not silent keys.,3,"First of all the keyboard is FAR from silent! Every time I hit the space bar there is a loud and very audible *clack*! Secondly, just know that you can't change the color scheme, it's just rainbow colored the whole time. You can change the brightness and the speed it *breathes*, but that's it! On the plus side it was ergonomic and comfortable for the 2 minutes I used it before unplugging it and preparing it for return, so there's that I guess. All in all like I said, I'm returning it, this is not what I wanted or expected.",100,3.0,2020,12,December,24
Ok keyboard but battery life sucks.,6,Perfect Christmas gift,3,4.0,2020,12,December,23
Not for gaming,3,"The keyboard must be either front, left or right of the keyboard, NOT behind you! I like to use my computer while kicking up my legs with my wireless keyboard on my lap, can't do it well all the time because of the range is so poor on this keyboard. I would need to move the entire tower another part of the room to suit my sitting style or buy a usb extender and hopefully move the signal usb stick that comes with the keyboard to in front of me than my tower being behind me.",96,1.0,2020,12,December,23

AWESOME,1,"It's nothing fancy so don't expect something over the top. Its a basic keyboard with an LED under lay. The keys are not mechanical so you will press a little harder.Customer support was great, my keyboard stopped charging and I reached out for help.

Old budget keyboard was hurting my fingers from extended use.-Feels light and minimalist-Had long sittings without needing to recharge (with backlight turned off)-It uses a USB-C charger.Cons:-No dedicated buttons for volume, etc.There are function shortcuts (FN+key) for volume control and calculator. This is nitpicking, but I guess I'd rather have the dedicated buttons for one press, instead of hitting the two combined.-The lighting has a distinct, high-pitched noise that is audible and frustrating.I had to turn it off completely. I didn't buy it for the backlight, but it's still a shame that I can't ever use it.",117,1.0,2020,12,December,20

I didn’t even connect it, simply started typing and was disappointed. 3 stars being generousMaybe the company is comparing their keys to a mechanical stroke keyboard, if that were the case.... then every keyboard would be “silent” compared to those.",78,5.0,2020,12,December,20

Good for generic typing,4,"I needed a wireless keyboard because I started using a standing desk and the less wires the better. I chose this one because it has both bluetooth and USB connection options and I wanted to be able to switch between my office computer and my personal tabtop. The lights are just really nice to look at and they give me a bit of cheer every time I lookdown at the keyboard. It's also really quiet which is nice and it types nicely too. I love that it is easy to take off the key caps and clean the keyboard and there are little ""drain holes"" in each key section to clean out the crumbs....say does anyone know what the word for all the crumbs and dust and stuff that gets stuck in your keyboard is?

Gaming,1," Light weight but feels solid. You feel the keys but no loud clicks. Easy to adjust the brightness and lighting modes. I wish there was a way to adjust the sleep timer, but other than that, I love it. Haven't had it long enough to comment on the battery live, but their USB C is a little short. Not a major issue for me, I have spares up to 10 feet long.Update on the battery life, it's great! Obviously it depends on use, but it lasts as long if not longer than other rechargeable keyboards I have used. The USB C recharges it fast when you need it to.I also have KLIM Blaze wireless mouse and Fusion earbuds. Love I can use the same cable to charge the mouse and keyboard.

Works great!,2,"KLIM customer service is amazing. First keyboard I got, wouldn’t connect and became a dud within 2 weeks of use. They sent a brand new one, and it’s been perfect.I still use it, and it’s good for generic typing. However after continuous, everyday use for 40+ hours a week, I’ve begun to choose to only use it on days I may be less busy/typing less quickly.The longer I use it, or the more I have to quickly type it will glitch out. It adds unnecessary keys I know I did not hit, or will duplicate a key stroke. (I.e. Hello looks like Heelloo).All in all, good witless keyboard. Love that it can be charged with a cord, battery life is great, wakes up quickly and has good response time after “sleeping”.

The fact that it is water proof or even water resistant is a bonus.  It is not a completely silent keyboard, but there is very little sound.  Key action is not quite as firm as a mechanical keyboard but not squishy.  Battery life remains to be seen, but it is casually used daily for at least 5 hours with no issues and I only charged it once in a week.  An charge indicator led would be a plus.

Cheap.,1,"This keyboard is excellent. I would buy it again. I use it for gaming. I have no complaints in that regard. I have a set up where my PC is in another separate room from my bedroom. It's connected to my TV via 15 foot HDMI/power cables. Even through the wall, it still manages to get good reception with minimal lag (occasionally if I'm positioned really far away in my bedroom (on my bed, rather than in my gaming chair), it will have some brief/noticeable lag, but if I turn it off/turn it on again, it goes back to normal). This issue won't be a problem for most people since they will likely be in the same room as their PC. I don't want to b/c I don't like the noise (however small) that any PC makes.The biggest issue I have with this keyboard is the sound it makes when the RGB is on. It's this high pitched squealing sound. It goes away as soon as the RGB is turned off. This isn't a problem for me since I don't care about RGB one bit and prefer to have it off so it saves battery. But everytime the keyboard turns on, the RGB is automatically on, and hence the sound is immediately there when I turn it on, and I have to turn it off everytime, which is a minor inconvenience. Then again, I'd probably have to do turn it off anyways since I turn off the lighting to save battery. But the sound is noticeable. It's not as loud as a computer fan or anything. But since it's high pitched, you won't not notice it.",276,1.0,2020,11,November,27
great keyboard (the best i every use it is true not advertising),12,"Wouldn't take a charge and charge light kept turning off.  Just as bad, the keyboard lighting wouldn't stay on which defeats its whole purpose.  Very disappointed and returning product.",29,5.0,2020,11,November,27
Great purchase!,2,I love it 10/10,4,5.0,2020,11,November,27
I've long wondered why colored keys are all that great,10,"It arrived with a slight crack- picture of crack in front of keyboard attached.  This keyboard was purchased for my son, to help with school from home.  Since he was excited to use it and it would be helpful, and since there's a pandemic, I didn't want to have to ding around with going someplace to return it, and I didn't want to be without it.  So far it works, and the light up colors make him interested in using it which possibly translates to him doing a better/more timely job with his schoolwork.  Hopefully the crack does not cause it to fail sooner than expected.",106,5.0,2020,11,November,24
XBOX MUST HAVE,3,"I have the KLIM wireless keyboard and like it quite a bit.  My work space is rather limited and I find it handy to pick up the keyboard and move it out of the way while I am multi tasking.  It’s also handy that the keyboard lights up as my eyes get tired and  I often forget to put my glasses on, so the light up keys are helpful.  I do wish the on/off switch was in a handier place however.  However, I am not a gamer, so I don’t know how it might rate in that category.  Otherwise I like the keyboard for all other reasons, weight, size, price and overall usage.",113,5.0,2020,11,November,24
Awesome keyboard for work and gaming,6,Smooth feeling keys. Nice design,5,5.0,2020,11,November,24
Does what I wanted,4,"So, I got it for my boyfriend who wanted a gaming keyboard but no wire. It was on time in the mail. Looked like it was a returned item with all the tape trying to keep the box together but as it came in the original packaging it makes sense.While it was plugged in we turned it on to see the lights. It was very low with other lights interfering but visible at night or in darkness.We left it to charge as instructed and it never charged. When it was, it lasted 5 minutes at most. The keyboard connected to the laptop as we saw it under the devices but it wouldn't type or send any sort of input in.Overall, wasn't a good buy on my part but for a gift for a gamer boyfriend who hage wires he liked it while it lasted.",144,4.0,2020,11,November,24
This is the best!,4,"the tested latency was 38ms.this keyboard also goes to sleep every 60 seconds, I dont know if you can change this .The deal killer for me was the  space and enter key they were horrible. extremely mushy ive been around keyboards since windows 3.1 i know what im talking about.",50,5.0,2020,11,November,24

Died mid game,3,"I play games like World of tank Blitz and FS2 that uses WASD to control a lot. The keyboard really helps me to reduce the load of the original laptop's keyboard. However, this keyboard battery life is not so long that you need to charge probably every 3-4 days if  you play about 2 hours averagely. Plus, it is not so friendly in helping you talking through typing since the arrangement always makes me type out lots of typos.",79,1.0,2020,11,November,22

Decent keyboard but no charging cable,6,I purchased this item to play World of Warcraft. I also use a wireless mouse and the keyboard doesn’t work in game if mouse USB is also plugged in.

No longer charging,3,"Its a cheap made useless keyboard. Range is horrible. Sleep mode activates way to soon.

Terrible keyboard,2,"...So, out of boredom, I ordered one of these gaming keyboards. This one from KLIM and got into the head of the gamer. I must say there is a tangible cool factor to a ""battle-ready"" keyboard. Everything is in the spirit of the gamer. There is an air of science and fantasy as you email your coworkers something really mundane.Aside from that, here's what else the KLIM offers(+) The keyboard is nice and quiet.(+) Accuracy is the same as with my old keyboard.(+) Turning off the lights in my home office and typing from a colorful keyboard is cool.",99,1.0,2020,11,November,16

Works great with my PS4,5,"KLIM is a fantastic company.  I had never heard of them before purchasing this keyboard and I have no ties to them. I had some trouble with the dongle connecting to the keyboard out of the box.  KLIM technology support service was amazing and went above and beyond. The service is friendly and fast. The keyboard itself is awesome. My daughter (12) said the keyboard is so nice she just wants to type things even when her work is done. Great for gaming, looms and feels great.

BACKLIGHTING A JOKE,3,This worked great for a while. But after some months of regular use it has gotten glitchy. Sometimes it stops communicating with my computer.

I have 2 other wireless keyboards that will last a week before I have to recharge them. Using this one for about the same about of time, I have been having to recharge it multiple times a week. Not sure if the backlight is draining the battery that much but that seems like a major difference. Some of the keys sometimes stick or don't seem to respond unless you press them very hard.",92,5.0,2020,10,October,31

AMAZING KEYBOARD,2,"If you want a keyboard with backlighting, then this is not the keyboard for you. It does not stay backlit for more than a minute, when not being used, which is more than annoying.

The keyboards brightness is perfect as I don't have to adjust the monitor's brightness too high.The fact that it is rechargeable with a type C makes it ideal as I can charge my phone as well.

Not that good,3,"I expected more considering its the most expensive keyboard I've ever bought. Customer support is useless. The lights were cool when it worked consistently.

Send used/refurbished products as “new”,5,"This is my third try at a wireless backlit keyboard. The first two were from different manufacturers. The first two consistently duplicated and omitted many keystrokes. FINALLY found one that does what I expected it to do. The adjustable brightness backlight works fine and all keystrokes are accurate. The key profiles are not as tall as other products in this category which is good for me. I wouldn't think that should matter, but I found the taller keys on some of the others to be annoying.  I like the somewhat minimal footprint for a full feature keyboard as space on my desk is limited. I don't use this for gaming, but sometimes I have to get up in the middle of the night for a work call and the adjustable brightness backlit keyboard is a welcome feature so I don't have to turn on the room lights for two minutes of computer work at 5AM. Overall, I am very pleased.",160,1.0,2020,10,October,12

Buy it,2,"Nothing special about this keyboard. I’m not fond of the manufacturers website.Adding to this review. After less than a year of use the battery is failing.

I have my home office set up at the kitchen table. My daughter also uses it for school. I love that it is not too bright, but lights up just enough to see the keys when needed. I would recommend this to anyone with kids and those who needs to move around their work area frequently.",90,1.0,2020,09,September,24
A+++,1,The ENTER button is a huge issue. I love the keyboard except for the place and shape of the enter key. My finger hits that |\ button and the enter button all the time. The keyboard is perfect in everything else. I just can't get passed that part. I returned the keyboard and ordered KLIM Light V2 Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard US Layout for 29.95. That one has fix the ENTER button issue.,72,5.0,2020,09,September,24
Good keyboard at the right price,6,Worked great the first week. Stopped holding a charge and working after the second week. Sent back after a month of having because it wasn't worth the effort of charging to full only for it to work for 2 hours if at all. Can't even have it plugged in and charging while using so that wasn't even a possible work around. Bought a different brand and have been using for a few months without any issues. Don't waste your time with this wireless keyboard.,84,5.0,2020,09,September,23

Product not as described,4,"This keyboard looked great in the Amazon pix and had great reviews. Unfortunately, I never got around to actually trying it out until 4 days after the return window closed. I hate this thing, and will never use it, for several reasons:1) The actual keys don't light up, just the areas underneath them, and it's VERY dim.2) It's not bright at all, and I can't distinguish any changes when I use the brightness keys.3) The ""static breathing"" doesn't change at all when I press the keys.",86,2.0,2020,08,August,30
Excellent keyboard and value,4,Absolutely in love. Exceeded expectations. Highly reccomend!!,7,5.0,2020,08,August,29
Great keyboard,2,"This keyboard looks and feels really nice. It's nice and quiet and I like the rainbow color display. I don't game much so I can't really opine on its quality there but I imagine the feel and reach of it is nice for those that do, although that big Enter button might throw you off a little bit if you're not used to the layout - I kept hitting the Insert key instead of the backspace from time to time.I have a 3-screen display, two are daisy-chained monitors using DisplayPort and one is a TV using HDMI. I noticed that in its regular position on my desk, it seemed to type fine on screen 1, have a somewhat delayed buggy input on screen 2, and perhaps due to the distance between the dongle and the TV, no response on there.I moved the dongle to the keyboard to the top of my tower instead of the back side, but it still didn't accept any input from my keyboard when I wasn't even 6 feet away from my computer - to me, that on top of not seeming to properly respond to my other screens is a large drawback for a wireless keyboard, especially when I paid $60 for it. I had a cheaper Logitech that worked just fine for about 15 feet, and I only got this one because it died three years later to the day and that model seems to be discontinued.I want to like this because it works great when it wants to, but the problems I've had just in the first week aren't worth what I paid for it. I almost never return anything but I think I'm gonna have to with this.",286,5.0,2020,09,September,21

DO NOT BUY Using typing from my different my stock keyboard,11,I love this keyboard and it works & looks great but a warning to anyone else with small hands - it's a little hard to use.

Budget friendly gaming keyboard. ***updated***,5,"It is a pretty keyboard, but the battery life is extremely disappointing. I've had to plug it in to recharge about 5 times now and it only just arrived 10 days ago. :(",33,2.0,2020,09,September,19

Window Key Stopped working after 3 months.,7,"The keys themselves are fairly quiet, but the space bar appears to only be anchored in one spot, so it clicks when you press it.  Calling this keyboard silent is false advertising.  Also, I have had the problem with using the left ctrl+shift keys in a keystroke sequence, like when clearing cache or opening an incognito window, which I regularly need to do for work, the right ctrl+shift keystroke works though.I do like the battery life and the backlight, but I will be returning this and looking for something different.",90,1.0,2020,09,September,17
Poor Keyboard,2,"This is a great keyboard.  The keys are quiet and don't travel far when pressed down.  It lights up well enough to be seen clearly in the dark, and despite being make out of plastic instead of aluminum it seems fairly sturdy.  That said, this is not the keyboard for me.I'm an old-school computer programmer, and I am on my keyboard all day long.  I prefer a loud, clicky keyboard reminiscent of the old IBM PC keyboard.  This keyboard is nothing like that.  It's extremely quiet, and the keys don't travel far when pressed.  I was looking for a borderline typewriter feel.  This keyboard is more for gaming and such.Again, this is a great keyboard and clearly matches its marketing.  It was just not the keyboard I was looking for.",130,1.0,2020,09,September,17
Neon Glowing Keyboard!,3,Purchased it for my son who is a gamer.  He picked it out after doing the research on Amazon. He really enjoys the every aspect of the keyboard.  It is lightweight therefore he has taken it with him abroad.,39,5.0,2020,09,September,16
"Nice looking keyboard, but looks aren't everything",7,"After 2 months stopped working. None of the key functions work & the keyboard is fully charged. Should have read the negative reviews. Like others have said stopped working right after the return window closed. Also, for what this cost the lighting on it should stay on constant but it doesn't. You have to hit a key for it to come on. They charge way too much for this piece of garbage. Amazon needs to give more than a 1 month window for returns. Guess I'll stick to Best Buy for electronics. If I could have gave it less than one star I would have.",105,3.0,2020,09,September,16
Unreliable,1,I wanted to do 5 stars on this but I do have a slight issue with the design of the keyboard itself. It may be the best keyboard you have owned really; I've just broken so darn many it's unfunny. (Not this model - yet) My main gripe is the whole function key is right side only - which wouldn't be horrible (for me) if I wasn't consistently used to 1 handed volume and media controll. I may have just bought the wrong keyboard - there are other options; this is the one I bought and it was 60 bucks and I'm not pleased with it due to this. Again - may work wonders for you - a non media junkie.,121,3.0,2020,09,September,16

I’m not sure if it ‘s my software (Windows) or the keyboard, but it would light up and then go dark when I tried typing on it.

nice!,1,"Ill start with cons.*unresponsive sometimes.*doesnt tell if the battery is low, there is no indicator so if youre playing intensely and stops all of a sudden it will pissed u off a little.*keyboard sound is like so and so its not mechanical,it will make a sound depends how heavy you type.*You can't customize the RGB, its fixed.Pros*keyboard lights wont bother you if you play while the lights are off.*keyboard lights has 3 modes which is cool. Steady, Pulse and no lights. You can also adjust the light from low to high.*rechargable and has its own usb C type cable and has its own bluetooth connector to pc.*when charged it lasts quite long if you play casually it can go up to 3 to 4 days without charging.*it goes on sleep mode if not in use.*lightweight, I always put this on my lap since my pc is connected to my tv and I always play from my bed.*budget friendly, its a good keyboard.

The @ and "" (quotation mark) got switched. Its becoming more and more unresponsive. I got this 13 days ago and its not doing so well.Update on battery, it lasts 2 days max if used casually.I'am changing my review to 2 star and I dont recommend this now.

Complete Waste of Money,4,"Just like the head states, the windows key no longer functions. Also, I don't particularly appreciate that the lights on the keyboard do not stay illuminated for more than a few seconds. I work on three monitors, and I need a functioning windows key to move, you guessed it, my windows around using the shortcut windows + shift + arrow key. I figured it was my PC, so I changed to a different PC in the house. I had the same issue. Then I went back to my wired keyboard, no problems—another keyboard for the junk pile.",97,1.0,2020,09,September,08

Being cordless allows me to sit on the couch & play games, type e-mails, etc. without restrictions.  Best one i have had yet!",49,5.0,2020,09,September,07
Nice design,2,"This is a good looking keyboard. The rainbow colors you see are all you can get, so no selection of one color is available, although the brightness settings are adjustable which is nice. Not a critical issue, as I said, it's a nice looking keyboard. But functionally, there are a couple of issues that are immediately apparent.First, the enter key. As in the picture attached, has a notch in it that is shared with the \ key. I am CONSTANTLY hitting the \ and enter resulting in failed passwords and clutters chat messages. So at a minimum, it will take some time to get used to this and hit the enter key alone.Another issue seems to be battery life. Instructions indicate 4 hours to charge. I can accept that. What I can't accept is the life of the battery after. In the short time I have had this keyboard, it has died on my twice within a day of getting a full charge. So sleep function is either broken or poorly designed with regard to maintaining battery life. So now I am keeping it wired with the provided cable because I cannot be without a keyboard when it dies, and plugging it into a power source is not enough. Once the battery is dead, it will not power up until it has gotten enough of a charge to respond.  But connected to the PC via USB cable makes it online instantly. Overall a poor technical design.My only other complaint, and it could just be me adapting from laptop keyboards to a mechanical desktop keyboard again, but typing on this keyboard continues to feel clumsy. But while writing this review, I took a moment to look closer. The keys on this keyboard are probably a good 20% smaller surface area than either laptop I typically use. This adds to the closeness of the keys and why I am constantly off a key here and there typing as I normally do by feel alone. A square key up from the base versus the pyramidal shape of these keys would make them bigger and more tolerable. This is what may ultimately force me to try another keyboard and send this one back.",369,5.0,2020,09,September,06
DO NOT BUY THIS!,4,"The keyboard looks and feels nice to use. HOWEVER I have barely uses this keyboard and I am encountering connection issues. I open up a web browser go to start typing and nothing happens. I turn it off and on again. Wait a few seconds, then again start typing. It doesnt type. Then again a few seconds and it registered 3 letters. Other times it functions properly. Too unrealiable.",69,1.0,2020,09,September,05

Amazing!,1,">> UPDATE AFTER 1YR 2M OF USAGE: I used the keyboard almost everyday for a whole year - mostly for work rather than gaming and it is still like new! Then one day I had to switch out my laptop at work and forgot to take the USB receiver before turning it in. Unfortunately, I couldn't retrieve it and was beating myself up for it! Going back to using the laptop keys was  highly excruciating so I decided to take a chance and ask if the USB receiver was replaceable.Their customer service is PHENOMENAL. The same rep communicated with me throughout the process (have you ever played hot potato with customer service?? Then you know how amazing this feels) and she always responded pretty quickly to my emails - there was never a lag time! The only hiccup I ran into was at the very beginning when I searched for a customer service portal through Amazon. The initial link connected me with the KLIM technical riding gear rather than KLIM Technologies. However, they gave me the correct email address immediately and it was smooth sailing from there.They told me the USB receiver is replaceable (YAYYYY) but that a part was on backorder. I was more happy to know I'd be able to continue using the keyboard so I was willing to wait! A month later they provided an update that the part was still on backorder but that they were going to send me a new one!!! It arrived as promised and I can go back to typing comfortably and with lightening speed!!!<<<<I just got it and have only used it for a couple of hours but I'm thoroughly impressed by this keyboard! Smooth buttons, smooth typing, comfortable feel, and full sized buttons. And I now have a number key pad!The presentation was also impressive - a black little envelope with a seemingly personalized note - with a little flare - from the makers when you open the box. Love it.Just the quality of the keys make it obvious that it will be great for game play. The keys feel so light and smooth under my fingers as I type! I hope it lasts forever!",365,5.0,2020,08,August,19

Keys don’t work right,4,"First and foremost, I have had this keyboard almost a year now. The first keyboard I received was DOA which anyone who knows much about electronics knows that that is just how it is sometimes.  I contacted their customer support and within a week had a new keyboard. Initially this was amazing and I saw no issues but as time went on, it stopped charging properly I believe. I am on my computer long hours every day as I work from home and then game at night. If I charge it at night with the keyboard set to ""off"" it lasts the whole day normally. Even then sometimes it doesn't but overall it does. Other times even while it is plugged in, it shuts off randomly making gaming hard. If Klim were reading this I would suggest two things, add some way to show a battery charge on the keyboard, and upgrade the battery stability. This keyboard after a year is acting like the one that was faulty did. Just a year later. For those who are reading this, I would suggest this keyboard unless you use it 12/14 hours a day. It simply isn't built for that it feels like.",201,1.0,2020,08,August,17

Doesn’t last long whatsoever.*ORIGINAL Review*I had been looking for a wireless gaming keyboard that wasn't loud and had backlighting. It's not the perfect keyboard and I didn't expect it to with that price. The two things I would change in their second version would be to make the RGB a bit more versatile or customizable (to save a little on battery) and make the keys feel a little more ""clicky"" because hard to feel if the key went through sometimes. Overall, I love the weight, its durability, and slick look. I knocked it for two things but they are picky at this point.",147,2.0,2020,08,August,11

Great for everyday use,4,"It's a solid keyboard. It's feels very light, and less substantial that my previous, a MS wireless comfort keyboard which is still going strong after 10+ years. It also feels very soft to the touch, both the material itself and the key presses. I think part of this is in the waterproof design.What I really bought this for is:1) Smaller footprint than my previous keyboard. It's a full size keyboard that requires substantially less desktop space. It makes a difference for my use.2) Backlighting for when I'm typing at night and I don't want the harshness of an overhead light or even lamp sometimes. The backlighting on this is great if you're fine with the multi-color. There is an option to turn it off during the day and there is also a dimmer which works great.What doesn't work:1) It's weird but when editing text I often use ctrl+shift and the arrow keys to highlight large chunks of text at a time. So far this works on this keyboard, but only if I'm using ctrl+shift keys on the left side together or the right side together. It doesn't fully work when I use ""right ctrl + left shift + right arrow"" keys. Weird.2) I would have much preferred a standard sized carriage return (Enter key for you youngins). Now to press enter, my pinky has to travel much farther and it takes noticeable effort. The old school ""reverse L"" shaped Enter key is king. I hope maybe on the 2021 version they will correct this. If they did, it would be worth buying again for that change alone.I'm still getting adjusted to the slightly new layout and key response. My typing isn't as fast yet. I find with this soft key press business, I have to press a little more aggressively to get the space bar for instance to register. It's slight, but noticeable. Whether you think that's a good thing or not is up to you. Definitely needs a palm rest. Sensitive hands/wrists may still prefer the design of a curved keyboard. I swear by curved/split keyboards. They make a difference. I don't use it for gaming, so no comment there. I'm imagine it's responsive enough.",366,5.0,2020,08,August,09

Read all the reviews before buying!,6,"At first, this keyboard was everything I wanted in a wireless keyboard. I have always been skeptical of wireless keyboards. It worked wonders at first but as I started to work with it there would be very random connection issues where it would not register my typing.This seller was kind enough to send me a second keyboard even and the same issue was happening. I really do think it was an issue with my very many wireless electronics nearby, but never found out what the issue was.However, I gave this a 4 star rating because of how well it worked when it did and for the customer service. I don't leave very many reviews, but this seller really does deserve credit for a great customer service experience as well as making a great product, however unfortunate it did not work for me. They were even kind enough to send me a gift for the inconvenience AND gave me a coupon voucher for their other products.Excellent service!",166,2.0,2020,08,August,05
great for gaming,3,I like the back lit keys but the keyboard has really short battery life.  We have to charge it a few times/week and we do not use it all day.,30,5.0,2020,08,August,05
Amazing Quality! Great Wireless Range! Quite!,6,I had a wireless keyboard before I purchased this one. It lagged while I typed and sometimes would have to sit for half a minute before I could start again. I love this keyboard. It's does everything I need it to do. Love fact I can charge it and never needs batteries to be replaced.,55,5.0,2020,06,June,22
Really nice keyboard for sure!,5,"The product arrived in an undamaged box, with the details of the keyboard on the back. Upon opening the box there was the keyboard, a small envelope, and a user manual in several languages. The keyboard had the wireless connector in the back, and a power switch to turn it on.  Inside the envelope was a note on how the shipping was processed, along with branded stickers. The keys on the keyboard all work very well and do make a nice clicking noise. Overall I am very happy with this product and would be happy to get other products from the same brand.",103,4.0,2020,08,August,05
worst keyboard ever,3,"I'll first mention that if you are buying this, you probably don't want to spend an arm and a leg for a gaming keyboard, however, you definitely get the most for what you pay for.I've been using this keyboard for months now, and though it isn't as comfortable or bright as others it gets the job done. I don't really care too much about the light features (fading mode, breathing mode) but my biggest problem is the brightness of the light. If the room is well lit you can definitely tell RGB is lit, but its a bit dimmer than I expected. At night I was hoping to clearly see the major change in color between the keys on the keyboard but the keys do not allow a lot of light through the transparent plastic on each key. You can see the color very clearly BETWEEN the keys but not so much for THROUGH each key. The only improvement I suggest would be to make the keyboard slightly less harsh on the hands after hours of typing and increasing the maximum brightness of the keyboard. Besides that, the battery is fine for the price and you can still use the keyboard if the battery dies by plugging it in, which is pretty convenient.Like I said you get what you pay for and this is more than fine. Klim did pretty well and this keyboard has lasted me several months without any major issues.",243,1.0,2020,08,August,05
It's very quiet while typing.,5,"this is the best rgb keyboard value you can find out there. The size is jsut perfect, not too big or too slow.",23,5.0,2020,08,August,04

A month after I am able to return the keyboard the A and L button stopped working,17,"Product loos great and it feels awesome, however I am experiencing a HUGE issue when it comes to the keyboard not responding to me typing. I'd have to turn the keyboard off or plug in a usb cable to it and sometimes it still acts as if I didn't enter a key. This is very frustrating. I've checked to see if it was device drivers, anything that's not updated on  my system, manufacturer's website, etc. Still experiencing this issue. Does anyone know how to resolve this. If so this product would definitely receive a 5tar rating!",96,1.0,2020,07,July,31
Great Keyboard for Gamers!,4,Great wireless keyboard for my Xbox one.,7,5.0,2020,07,July,31
Nice feeling,2,"Many functions in many programs use CTRL+SHIFT.  CTRL+SHIFT does not work in any way on this keyboard. This is unexpected and totally unacceptable behavior in a keyboard. These key combinations are intrinsic to many functions in Windows. It is time to return for a refund. Darn. I liked the size and feel, but functionality is compromised and I need a working keyboard - not a crippled one.",67,5.0,2020,07,July,30
Very Nice Keyboard,3,"We finally find a good replacement for our old wireless keyboard. This one is good. I had tried using it to play Dark Souls 3. Even the keyboard is about 3 meters away from my PC, it's still very responsive while playing this game. Very satisfied.No return this time and certainly 5 stars for this item.",56,5.0,2020,07,July,29
Could have been better.,4,I really like this keyboard.  The keys are soft and the back light colors are not too bright.,18,2.0,2020,07,July,29
Worked for 2.5 months,4,"--Update--Still liking the keyboard after ~5 months of daily use. My only two issues are:1. The ""\"" button location is terrible. I am mostly used to it at this point, but still accidentally press ""\"" instead of ""Enter"" all the time.2. Although the battery life is good, there is no indicator for ""low battery"". This means the keyboard will just unexpectedly stop in the middle of typing when it's dead.----I have been using this keyboard daily for the past three weeks. I use it about 8 hrs a day during the work week and have had to charge it twice since getting it. Pretty good!It is by no means a ""silent"" keyboard, but it is much quieter than my previous keyboard and is not disruptive to my office mate/husband. I am a reasonably fast typer (~90 wpm) and the keyboard is responsive. Don't expect it to blow your mind, but you will be pleasantly surprised at the quality you are getting for less than $40.",165,1.0,2020,07,July,29
Not so quiet...,3,"The keyboard is definitely quiet.  But the enter key is in an awkward position.  If you learned how to type and don't hunt and peck, you will constantly be hitting the slash key, rather than the enter key.  This gets very frustrating when trying to type reports and documents.  It has a nice look, and my kids thought it was cool with the colors.  But sadly, it was returned due to it not being practical for my needs",78,4.0,2020,07,July,27
USB cord only charges,4,"I've used this for a few months. It worked great at first. It would die on me after a few hours of using, so I was pretty good about plugging it in when I wasn't using it. Now, it just sometimes straight up doesn't work, which gets pretty frustrating. I'll even try to keep the power chord plugged in, and turn it off and on again, and it still doesn't work. That is very inconvenient. At that point, I'll just have to turn it off, keep it plugged in, and take a break from whatever I'm doing.",97,3.0,2020,07,July,26
Don’t buy,2,"I received the keyboard with a defective dongle. I had talk to the customer service about it and they were very nice and helpful. I received a new one a few weeks later and the new one doesnt work either. I looked up how to sync it with the keyboard and after many attempts, it just wont work. I'm sad because the keyboard looks cool and I would very much like to use it. Maybe it's just my luck of getting defective receivers.",83,1.0,2020,07,July,26
Conocer el producto,3,"The 3 things I hate about this keyboard were mentioned in the reviews, but I overlooked them. This product is not made in the USA even though there is an American flag displayed suggesting it is. The supplied cable is only 2 feet long and does not insert fully into the keyboard, so factor in  the price of a  6 foot cable that does insert, as I had to do. Finally the keyboard lights time out after a minute of non use, EVEN if you leave it plugged in and battery life is not an issue.",96,2.0,2020,07,July,26

Amazing underrated keyboard,3,"I didn’t buy this to game but, to use with my MacBook that is connected to my multiple screens. Liked it b/c of the lit up keys. I find them to be hard to push and not comfortable. I guess I could just be used to my Mac keyboard and just being too hard on how the keyboard is supposed to function. I would like for it to stay lit up all the time while it breathes (lights up as if it were breathing)! I guess I can understand why it doesn’t. I like it and would recommend it though. It is relatively plug and play even on my Mac. Works a lot better for sure on Windows systems for all the other functions of the keys.",127,5.0,2020,07,July,24

GREAT wireless keyboard,3,I had a solid green back-lit keyboard that stopped working. I wanted another solid color but I could not find one.  So I bought this one that has a multi-color back light. I have to say I like it better.  Also the keys feel much more substantial and it has an on off switch that I like as well.  Works from a decent distance also.  Recommend.,66,5.0,2020,07,July,20

"Extra key near ""Enter"" button make it totally unusable!",9,"Purchased back in November 2019, I thought this keyboard would have lasted a lot longer. When I first purchased the keyboard it worked fine on my PC. After a month it stopped working and gave a message saying the Bluetooth software is outdated.  I went to the KLIM website to update the Bluetooth by downloading a file that didn't work. I connected the keyboard to another PC still would not work. Literally the keyboard stopped working after a month due to the Bluetooth being outdated or not compatible. What a waste of money.",93,3.0,2020,07,July,18

Out the box everything great,5,"The keyboard initially works well and after a few minutes when you type one the text does not appear and I write several things and do not mark the text, it is a fault that affects my work 100%, regarding the colors it has two lighting modes, the first is so that it never turns off and without 3 colors on the keyboard and the second is so that it turns on and off, I thought the lighting was color by color, I will write the provider to help me with the key problem and that will depend on my qualification",101,5.0,2020,07,July,13

Awesome keyboard from an Awesome company,6,"The keyboard remains responsive and in perfect working order after a month of regular use. I do have a fancy Logitech  gaming keyboard with all the bells and whistles but I prefer the quiet keys of the KLIM. Quiet doesn't mean unresponsive in this case, the keys feels sturdy, and satisfying.I love that it uses USB -C for charging or wired gaming and the battery life is surprisingly long.",69,5.0,2020,07,July,11
Very sleek,2,"Pros: Everything about this keyboard is really good.• The keys are SUPER quiet like advertised. My pc gaming setup is right next to our bed so if I play at night when my wife is sleeping it does not wake her up because how silent the keys are.•The rgb light brightness controls are awesome too. Again allows me to keep the keyboard bright enough to see in dark without blinding me or my wife while she sleeps if I game at night.• The color tones of the rgb lights are very nice, pleasing to look at.Cons:• The keys feel “sticky” with every press. Feels as if there was a sticky substance holding down the keys for a fraction of a second when depressed. But only a little. Not too big of a deal but some gamers might find this very annoying.• There are only two (2) rgb light options to choose from, breathing effect and constant back lite. Would be nice if there were more lighting effect options.",168,5.0,2020,07,July,10

Great Keyboard,2,When I bought this wireless keyboard I was expecting to be able to use my keyboard from my couch which is probably about 15” away from my computer MAX. I can’t get more than about 5 feet away before this terrible dongle starts to lose connection. I am using the same usb extender I had my Xbox one controller dongle on. So it was as far from the rest of my equipment as I could make it with direct line of site to my klim keyboard And still dropped the connection completely after about 10 feet. This is definitely only an okay keyboard if you are sitting at a desk right next to your computer. But needless to say I’m very disappointed.,122,4.0,2020,07,July,08

Will not function if you need to move the usb,10,"I do wish that the sleep mode was a bit longer, as I worry that drains the battery life a bit. The first one I received needed to be replaced after a month. However, I LOVE this keyboard. I contacted the seller via their official website, not through Amazon, and they sent me a replacement free of charge. Great customer service. I use this keyboard about 8-10 hrs a day during the work week, and usually charge it every other day. It is nice that you can still use it while it is charging.I did not realize how loud my original office keyboard was until the first one of these died. I even messaged my coworkers and apologized. This keyboard is quieter than my original Dell keyboard. If I had to choose, I would buy a wired keyboard, only so I didn’t have to worry about charging. But I really love this keyboard.

Great gaming wireless keyboard,4,"This is a good looking keyboard.  It is wireless with a SHORT USB C charging cable.  It can barely reach from my desktop to the USB port in the front of my computer!  Also, I WFH like many of us right now. I'm a tax accountant and HAVE to have 100% accuracy in everything I type!!  This keyboard has a LAG. Doesn't matter whether its on or off the charger. I type 90+ wpm and it cannot keep up. Due to the lag it also misses many digits from the 10 key keypad.  Due to this lag I had an unnoticed typo in a zip code, for an IRS form - my new boss was NOT HAPPY I missed this (which of course I shouldn't have except for the lag) and I almost lost my new job !!!When the keyboard is not being charged, it will start to freeze and lag and generally miss numbers and letters...then I realize i need to put it on the charger. So i plug it in and its working OK. Then next thing I know an hour or so later, it starts doing the same thing again, so i need to take it OFF the charger.  Then another hour or so it does it AGAIN now I need to put it on the charger. TERRIBLE! I've never had such a problem with a charger before EVER.  I wanted to return the product as it was NOT CHEAP! But looks like I have no option for return. I purchased on 5/8/20 and with the hullabaloo of a starting a new job, I hadn't realized I was slipping out of the exchange and return window.

Great keyboard helps my old eyes .,7,"The keyboard works wonders! I love how accurate and speedy it is, and how it shuts off when not in use to save power! In addition to that, KLIM is such a wonderful company with EXCELLENT customer service. I had misplaced my wireless dongle (the little black usb piece that is for the keyboard) and they were more than happy to send me a new one at no extra charge. They even included a little french candy with my dongle! I LOVE KLIM!!",83,5.0,2020,06,June,02
Stopped working,2,"This keyboard is amazing! It came well packaged like a high quality item. And I feel like the little details matter when buying a product. I love the extra effort they made with the thick papered, high quality small envelope that had decals and stuff in it. The LEDs are bright and the keys are very quite. It also has holes in the bottom which is nice if you accidentally spill something on it. It has great wireless range. My desktop is hooked up to my TV and the couch is about 10-12 ft away and has no connection problems. Overall this is an amazing value for the low price and I'll continue buying from this company as I expand my home business into a larger business.",127,1.0,2020,06,June,11
Easy and ready to use keyboard,6,Excellent wireless keyboard just what we needed.,7,5.0,2020,06,June,11
Wireless is not wireless,4,"Ok, so I love my new keyboard; however, there is one thing that is going to drive me crazy.Aside from by phone & watch, I am terrible about having to recharge things.  I am using this keyboard for work, and it's died on me twice. It's definitely my bad, but still, never had to worry about recharging a keyboard before.So if you are like me, you may want to reconsider, otherwise, no complaints.",73,3.0,2020,06,June,10
Works great,2,Bought this for my husband and he loves it and all the lights!,13,5.0,2020,06,June,10
Little to no warning before shutting off,7,My husband bought this keyboard for me and we both love it. Apparently according to him I am a heavy typer and I am loud AF when I type on a normal keyboard on this one he says he can’t hear anything.. which is awesome. I play wow and other pc games and for me the keybindings and lit up back helps a lot. It’s light seems durable and the company that supplies this sends the most awesome thank you letter for buying it. Lol the thank you letter was so funny and unique I seriously wish I could send the owner of the company a award for most unique thank you! It’s an awesome keyboard and if I needed another one would totally buy it again.,127,4.0,2020,06,June,09
AMAZING PRODUCT BY AN AMAZING COMPANY,6,Very good . I recommend this product,7,5.0,2020,06,June,08
Enter key hard to press,5,"This keyboard was a great buy at $29 - I am forced to replace it 7 months later (keys getting soft, worn) which would have been fine at the $29 price point but now the price has almost DOUBLED - going to seek out a more reliable brand for slightly more money",52,2.0,2020,06,June,08
Great Value,2,"I like the sleep feature for battery preservation, as well as the backlight. It's smart about how it manages all of that. The range is great, I'm able to use this from about 10' away in my living room for use with the big screen while my laptop was tucked away under/in my entertainment center. Works well while charging (if needed) also. Highly responsive while gaming, no delays noted.",69,5.0,2020,06,June,08
Good buy.,2,My grad daughter loves this keyboard. She purchased with her grad money! The price was right and shipped was fast.,20,5.0,2020,06,June,08
Not quality,2,"I wanted to like this colorful keyboard. Unfortunately, after troubleshooting for ages I have been unable to fix this problem. The keyboard literally just stopped working. Lights shut off and no connectivity regardless of the USB being connected. Regardless of restarting and updating my computer. I tried different USB ports on the off chance it was my computer, but they are all working for other USB connected products. I have unfortunately come to the conclusion that the problem isn't my computer, but the keyboard. I don't know if I can return it this far out but I will try.",99,1.0,2020,06,June,08
Worth the money,3,All reviews that said this keyboard is quiet or silent are liars,12,5.0,2020,06,June,07
"Great Response, Easy Install, Great Product",6,"Item worked fine for a month or two of light use and all the sudden it just doesn't work thought the battery was dead sonI charged it, nothing. If I turn the switch off and on again it lights up for about a millisecond n goes dark again 0 keys work. Tried to contact amzon becuse the only option it gives is return but am outside of the 30 day window, but there not taking phone calls at this time, guess I wasted money I n this one. They do have an updated 2020 version keyboard that came out with right after I purchased this one but I wouldnt waste my money after this bad experience.",116,5.0,2020,06,June,07
It broke in less than a month.,7,This keyboard is very comfortable to use and the lights are not too bright. Love the layout of the colors. It seems to be very quick response when playing games.,30,2.0,2020,06,June,06
keyboard works well very pretty,5,Keys feel good under your fingers RGB is very cool,10,5.0,2020,06,June,05
Awesome,1,Packaging from amazon  was not great box a split wide open surprisingly no damage.,14,5.0,2020,06,June,05
Great keyboard so far,4,"I love the colors, feel of the keyboard, and how quiet it is. Only other thing was the shortcut keys. I didn't like not being able to change some of the shortcut keys on the board. Got in my way in some of my apps.  Didn't get much beyond that because the battery didn't last very long had to recharge it too soon. Sent it back due to the battery issue.  Other than the battery, the keyboard was great. I give it 4 stars, but reduced to 3 because of the battery.",92,5.0,2020,06,June,05
Awesome,1,I bought this keyboard for my son and he loves it. It lights up when he is using it and the lights go off when he isn't. The keyboard is quiet and it isn't too big. Really good buy.,39,5.0,2020,06,June,04

Love the wireless mobility!!,4,Stopped working less than a month after purchase.,8,5.0,2020,06,June,03
Very Nice Keyboard,3,My daughter loved her new wireless keyboard,7,4.0,2020,06,June,02
Awful Keyboard,2,What's the point of being wireless if I need to keep it plugged in for power all the time? Also why do the lights go to sleep so quickly? The writing on the keys is so light that I can't see them unless a light is shining all them.,49,1.0,2020,06,June,02
Great Keyboard,2,Great item,2,5.0,2020,06,June,02
Doesn't work half the time,5,"I like this keyboard.  It does everything I want it to do and I like the color scheme(I don't think that's changeable, but I could be wrong).  The only real problem I've had with the keyboard is that it will turn off with no warning that it's low on battery.  It also has a good feel to the buttons.",59,1.0,2020,06,June,02
Nice,1,"the enter key is hard to press after a month on these keyboards, i tried two of them but no difference.  im not out of the return window and am stuck with it....",33,4.0,2020,06,June,02
Stops working doesn't turn on,5,Great value for the money for an illuminated wireless keyboard. Very responsive.,12,1.0,2020,06,June,02
Nice keyboard,2,"For the price this object is probably my favorite keyboard I have ever had. It response great, has had no issues using plug-n-playing in different laptops, plugs, in and gets to working quickly. So far I have only charged it a couple hours two separate times and have been using it for constantly playing games since i bought it a month or more ago. So....my battery life in my personal experience with this has been amazing.I recommend this product, it is built much MUCH better that the few other KLIM products I have tested out. Well worth the money. That is my two cents, you do your research decide.",109,4.0,2020,05,May,31
Good physical design but has connectivity issues,7,"I bought the keyboard so I could play games in the living room and it was working fine. The lights were really pretty, the keys felt clean, and it was pretty easy to move around. However, less than a month after I bought it, the backspace key, L key, and R key stopped working.",54,2.0,2020,05,May,30
MADE IN CHINA,3,"Works very well, lights up looks great.  Maybe sleeps too soon...no big deal though.",14,1.0,2020,05,May,30
Space bar is loud.,4,So far I love it,5,2.0,2020,05,May,30
Everything,1,"The keyboard came today and so far I'm really enjoying it. Looks sleek and feels nice. For the price I'd say that this is a great buy. No problems to report, but it's only day one. Came very fast!",39,5.0,2020,05,May,29
Works as expected,3,I love the overall look and functionality wirelessly as well as rechargeable. Love the colors.,15,5.0,2020,05,May,29
Great Buy,2,"I would not recommend this keyboard, I loved it at first until the keys started breaking just from typing....7-broken keys in the first month alone",25,5.0,2020,05,May,28
great wireless keyboard,3,"Love being able to toss it on the bed when I'm deep into my hobbying and need some space. Wish the backlight stayed on a bit longer, but then I'd probably have to charge it more. Have no problem recommending this keyboard at all.",44,4.0,2020,05,May,27
Great gaming keyboard,3,"I'm pretty happy with this keyboard...except for one thing.  The ENTER key spans two lines and the pipe button is moved down a line.  This small feature really slows down my typing (especially in a UNIX environment).  I just can't seem to get past that.  Hopefully in time I will but switching between keyboards will likely be an issue.  Other than that...they key board lights up nice, holds a charge, is fairly easy to type on (I wish the keys were like 10% bigger) and I haven't tried swimming with it so I can't speak to the water proof part.  I can't exchange it because I already recycled the box.  I'll make it work for now.",116,5.0,2020,05,May,26
Its rechargeable,2,This is the second keyboard that I've ordered. Both had issues.  Very disappointing product.,14,5.0,2020,05,May,26
Works great.,2,This is a great keyboard for wireless quiet typing. I really like the use of the colors.,17,5.0,2020,05,May,26
Changes up the mood in a good way.,8,"It often stops working at random points. Even with a full charge there will be sudden fits where it won't respond for a good 3 seconds or it will be super laggy with its  inputs. I was an idiot, forgot it had warranty, and bought 2. the first one at least had the courtesy to wait a few months to bug out. Day 1 this thing bugged.But, I like the feel of the keyboard. Its a damn satisfying keyboard WHEN IT WORKS. The buttons are nice to press and the keyboard feels nice in general. That's why i bought another hoping the first was faulty. The lights are nice also. But I sadly cant recommend it if 2 keyboards have similar bugs. Hell, even typing this out was an ordeal(especially when i was listing the positives of it). I will be sending it to repairs, but i really hope they straighten this problem out.",154,3.0,2020,05,May,26
Garbage.,1,This keyboard has a nice look and feel. At 73 my eyes aren't what they used to be and this makes life a lot easier. The back lighting is adjustable. I spend a lot of time printing photo for the Grand Kids.,42,1.0,2020,05,May,25
"""cue"" and ""zero/parenthesis"" keys do not work anymore",8,Keys have a very smooth travel,6,2.0,2020,05,May,25
Space Bar Broke About 1 Hour After I Bought it,10,Sucks that $50 buys you a keyboard that just dies after a couple weeks. I know this only happens to some people that buy the product so if you wanna roll the dice go ahead.,35,1.0,2020,05,May,24
Wireless and wired!!!,3,"The key board looks amazing, but some of the keys don't work. B,N, and Delete, to name a few.",19,5.0,2020,05,May,24
I really like it,4,"This keyboard looks really good, but the description is deceiving as they claim it to be silent or quiet. This keyboard is so not close to being a quiet one. It has really loud keys which I wasnt a fan of.",41,5.0,2020,05,May,23
"KLIM, that is all.",4,"Someone has missed the point - there doesn't seem to be a way to ""keep the lights on"" either wirelessly (which is the point of purchasing a wireless keyboard) or wired - not a power saving move as the shut off timing is the same with the keyboard plugged in - the backlighting when it is on is not helpful as it barely shows through the key to highlight the number or letter but shows off the space around the keys, so when looking down on the keyboard the eye is drawn to the space around the keys instead of the key itself - completely uselessA strange design choice also interferes with the use of the keyboard - there is an extra key next to the ""enter/return"" which is really annoying - instead of hitting enter you are more likely to hit backslash which really makes entering passwords a joy - this key is above the enter key on every other keyboardA very bad choice on my part from all the wireless backlit keyboards available",175,5.0,2020,05,May,22
Broke after less than 3 months,6,"I was looking for a low profile keyboard, wireless and with a large ""enter Key""  This keyboard fits the bill..",20,1.0,2020,05,May,22
"Great look, poor connectivity",4,"PROS: The physical design of the keyboard is great.  Feedback on the keys is good, has a nice matte finish, lights are as advertised, and there are holes on the back of the keyboard which helps keep the keys clean and if you spill a liquid on it it can drain.CONS: A couple times a days the keyboard will disconnect intermittently on me.  It will become unresponsive and disconnect then reconnect rapidly.  Its not for very long, maybe 30 seconds to couple minutes and if I'm at the computer for 8 hours a day it will only happen a couple times.  But if I'm in the middle of a game it can be quite frustrating.  Never have had this issue with other wireless keyboards.  Not sure what the solution is but I tried reinstalling the driver.",136,2.0,2020,05,May,21
"Suitable keyboard but not even close to being ""quiet""",9,This POS is advertised as made in USA.  It is actually made in China.,14,3.0,2020,05,May,19
Probably not meant for Mac,5,"Goes into sleep mode too quicklyNo problem really, seems to be a good quality product",15,3.0,2020,02,February,04
Buyer beware,2," There are a few good things about this keyboard: lights, number keys, wireless, rechargeable, but the space bar is a major deal breaker for me. I was looking for a quiet keyboard to take notes during videoconferencing. The space bar is annoyingly loud. Even when typing without having to be quiet on a conference call, it is very annoying. My partner down the hall can here me typing. Good features on this keyboard but I really cannot stand the space bar. It's an instant return for me. The worst part is they market this as a ""quiet"" keyboard. It's far from quiet.",102,1.0,2020,05,May,18
Pretty dope I do have to say,7,This is a great value!!  I am using with my laptop as I dont like the keyboard on my laptop.  Love this!!,22,5.0,2020,05,May,17
Great service and merchandise,4,So far it works great hope it stays like that.,10,1.0,2020,05,May,17
light and cheap won't work after 3 months,8,The keyboard feels steady. The wireless connection is excellent. I just wish that the hand rest was at least 3 inches long since I use it on my lap.,29,1.0,2020,05,May,17
"Excellent, low profile keyboard, extremely quiet!",6,"I enjoy the snarkiness of the ppwk in the package.  Minus the space bar, all of the keys are very quiet.  I gave it a full charge before use- it worked immediately.  Backlighting turns off after its idle for a bit, a simple tap of any key wakes it up. I dig that the backlighting is multi-colored v. just plain white. Being that I'm not planning to use it for gaming, I'm going to need to get used to the shape of the 'enter' key. There is an additional key on the middle row where I would naturally hit enter. No biggie.  Minus 1 star because the space bar is quite loud.",112,5.0,2020,05,May,15
Great feel to they keys,5,Great gaming keyboard,3,5.0,2020,05,May,15

Soooo Pretty 😍,3,"Like, I use it for music production. It serves it purpose to Elevate the mood in room while creating Music compositions etc👍🏿",22,5.0,2020,05,May,12
Product works great until it doesn't,6,"Crap quality. Several keys fell off when it was being stored (not even in use)  and are now lost, rendering the keyboard useless. $30 down the drain!",27,2.0,2020,05,May,12
It’s awesome,2,"Bluetooth range is no problem, RGB color is good, keys are comfortable to use, but TWO keys stopped working. I use the ""cue"" key for gaming, so this basically defeats the purpose of buying this keyboard.",36,5.0,2020,05,May,12
Great buy,2,So Basically I Was Testing The Removable Keycaps To see if the they actually Worked so I tried it on the space bar and after I Took it out I Couldn’t Get It Back In And When I Got It Back In It Kept Falling out Idk If this was my fault or the keyboards Fault.,56,5.0,2020,05,May,11
Space bar is very loud. Enter key is further away than normal.,12, Love the colors! Love that it can be plugged in or wireless! Love it with my keyboard as well!,19,3.0,2020,05,May,10
It's a nice keyboard,4,Works great,2,5.0,2020,05,May,08
Battery Life is TERRIBLE,4,"What I like, Everything.What I dislike, Nothing.This review is actually the first thing that I'm typing with this new keyboard. The keys feel a little spaced out, but I've been stuck with tiny bluetooth keyboards using my phone as my computer. Which, this works flawlessly with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, and with the Dex setup, which I'm currently utilizing.I feel like I purchased a much more expensive keyboard than what I paid for this, the packaging and items inside are esquisite, the glow of the keyboard is bright, and fantasticly appealing. I wish this had a bluetooth format, but maybe the next Note 20+ will feature connectivity to 2.4ghz devices.",112,3.0,2020,05,May,07
M would be nice,4,After less than 3 months it’s already broken. Space bar is already busted :(  son had last keyboard for 2 years and never had an issue.  Very bummed.,28,1.0,2020,05,May,07
Good for the price,4,"This Keyboard looks fantastic especially with the breathing setting. But the connectivitiy is garbage. It makes gaming fristrating because the keybiard will lag, you will put in an input and it will take a few seconds to register if it registers at all. There is also no indicator if it is about to die. Fully charged it still lags.",59,3.0,2020,05,May,07
Stopped charging after two months!,5,"Works fine. Easy to install and use, but there is nothing ""quiet"" about this keyboard. It clacks along just like a regular one not advertised as quiet.",27,2.0,2020,05,May,04
Doesn't last,2,Although there is a large American flag pictured on the product description this keyboard is made in China. Nowhere in the description does it say that. I paid a premium for this keyboard for it to be made in the US and this is just false advertising.,47,3.0,2020,05,May,04
Great for gaming,3,"Well just saying not sure why the price is expensive besides the lights on background of keys it is the same basic keyboard you will find in the wireless section. I bought cause of how cool it looks. Also you have to keep charging the keyboard to ensure it is fully juiced up, so make sure you turn it off on the bottom so it wont die. I have not had to many times it died on me, but how often do you remember to cut your keyboard off or plug it up. Other than that item is perfect.",99,5.0,2020,05,May,02
Broken after less than a year,6,Highly recommended,2,2.0,2020,04,April,30
Lasted a little bit over six months,7,POS. Won't hold a charge after 3 months of light use. Can't return,13,2.0,2020,04,April,28
Dissatisfied with product,3,This is an excellent keyboard and exactly what I was looking for.  The keys are extremely responsive and I like the low profile of the keyboard.  Also the keys are extremely quiet and the different color lighting is cool.  Easy function button combinations controls functions such as turning the color lighting off or adjusting the dimness/brightness of the lighting. The packaging is great and I liked the message the company provides in a black envelope along with the stickers.  This product works great with a KVM switch.  Highly recommend.,89,1.0,2020,04,April,27
Awesome-sauce! Would buy again!,4,"I had never heard of this brand and was a little concerned I might be buying some weird off brand that was of poor quality. So glad that's not the case. This keyboard is all quality. They keys feel amazing to type on. The lighting comes with a few options (like adjusting brightness), and the whole thing feels sturdy. Set up was easy (of course). I was reading through the few inserts that come in the packaging, and there's even a cute description of how the keyboard was shipped to me.",91,5.0,2020,04,April,26
Love it!,2,I like the color and function of this key board .,11,5.0,2020,04,April,26
"Great design, long lasting battery",5,I bought this keyboard for work. I wanted something quiet but also had rgb even tho there is only the basic rainbow and it's not very bright. For the price this keyboard is well worth it. It's very light for easy travel and the keys also feel surprisingly nice to type on for long periods.,55,5.0,2020,04,April,24
Great for the price,4,Love the lights!,3,4.0,2020,04,April,23
no range at all,4,I have problems with this keyboard just deciding that I am not pushing the buttons anymore.  Even when leaving the keyboard connected directly to the computer at times it just stops responding and its incredibly frustrating when trying to game.,40,1.0,2020,04,April,23
Runs out of battery really fast,6,I actually use this keyboard for my workstation and it’s super awesome I love it and I don’t know what else to say about this product it’s super fun and it lights up when you’re typing and it’s awesome,39,2.0,2020,04,April,22
Broken USB receiver,3,Fantastic keyboard for its price,5,2.0,2020,04,April,22
Does not work for me,5,"I'm surprised how highly rated this keyboard is given that the space bar isn't quiet as advertised. This isn't a manufacturing defect; it's the actual design. Besides that problem, the enter key is a whole key further away compared to most keyboards. I found myself repeatedly pressing where the key should be, but that place is occupied by the backslash. Another problem is that in Ubuntu 18.04 the keyboard shortcut for create a new folder doesn't work on this keyboard.",80,1.0,2020,04,April,22
Nice key board,3,"It's a really great keyboard, the only thing I don't like is that you are unable to change the color, other than that it's perfect.",25,5.0,2020,04,April,22
it's a great product,4,You will be needing to charge this Keyboard EVERY day.  I've had keyboards that lasted for months on a single charge.  This is definately not one of them.  Other than that it's a great keyboard.,35,5.0,2020,04,April,22
Faulty Keyboard,2,The M Key doesn’t work! Pretty hard to do anything when a pretty important letter is not able to be used.,21,1.0,2020,04,April,22
Poor battery but otherwise good quality,6,"Ok product for price point. Wish battery lasted longer. The keys are a little awkward. Have to press harder than a normal keyboard. But for the price, I’m happy. Love it in the dark. Wish you could change the rainbow effect to a solid color, but happy overall. I use it for work, so I cannot give a full review for gaming. But I did like the fact no software needed to be installed.",74,3.0,2020,04,April,21
"Battery life: good, not great",5,"Looked nice while it lasted, but it wouldn't charge after two months of light use.",15,4.0,2020,04,April,21
No setting for backlight to stay on,7,"I've bought this keyboard twice now.  It works great... for a few months.  Honestly, it is my favorite keyboard I've used so when my first one went out after about 3 months I bought another.  Unfortunately, that one lasted four months and konked out as well.  It just does this thing where it flickers on for a second then turns right off.  Would love to buy another one but don't know if I can justify buying a keyboard that I now assume I will have to repurchase in another 3-4 months :/",92,4.0,2020,04,April,20
Good keyboard,2,Its amazing,2,4.0,2020,04,April,20
I don't like the keys,5,"Lightweight, nice looking, wireless, fair price, but it's stopped working after less than a year. Really liked this keyboard, but I'm dealing with a keyboard that is outputting constant characters to the computer and I can't imagine how to fix it. If I turn this on it locks up my computer and tries typing numbers and odd ASCII characters. Shame!",60,3.0,2020,04,April,20
KLIM wireless rgb keyboard,4,"After using this as an everyday keyboard for six months now there are a few problems with. Even with a full charge the keyboard will randomly power off, have missed keystrokes and there's no way to tell how much charge is left in the battery. It is quiet however but I wouldn't use it as an everyday keyboard.",58,5.0,2020,04,April,20
great!,1,Some keys stopped working 2 months of use. I contacted the KLIM for assistance and I was not able to get the keyboard exchanged for a new one. I will no longer purchase any electronics from KLIM.,37,5.0,2020,04,April,19
Worth it!,2,"Great product!! My 14 year old is new to gaming & loves his keyboard. The colors are fantastic. He had a great time with the included product stickers decking out his pc casing, headphones, etc. plus the letter/product literature that came with the keyboard personalizes the product. You feel a connection to the folks who put their TLC into the product. Thx!",62,5.0,2020,04,April,19
Holds charge for a long time,6,"Have been using it nonstop since I got it. The look of the keyboard is super sleek and nice. Love the colors and the auto shut off of the lights when not being used. Has a type c charger so it works great with your phone charger if you have an android phone. Keys do not make noise which is nice. Connected quickly to my laptop, no problems at all. Wish the company would make a wireless mouse to go with this keyboard though.",84,5.0,2020,04,April,17

Loved by my 13 yr you let son,8,"everything is perfect but the whole point while i got this was because its wireless. but wireless is useless if theres no reception after 3 feets.after a year or so i can't remember, it stopped working. all it does now is just flashing light back and forth when i try to type something in...",54,5.0,2020,04,April,15
Awesome!,1,"Overall it is a good keyboard. but it runs out of battery really fast.My own does not hold on for more than 3 or 4 days. I would expect to hold the battery for 3 or 4 weeks, or even months.Every week I have to connect into the USB port to recharge.When connected to USB port, I still have to connect the bluetooth adapter. which makes me use an extra USB port.Why not just use the USB cabe to also communicate with the PC? why do I have to use both while charging the keyboard?",95,5.0,2020,04,April,15
Failure to respond,3,The USB receiver got stuck in my laptop USB port. I ended up having to get it out with pliers. Fortunately this didnt cause any damage to the USB port. Very disappointed in this product as the keyboard no longer works AT ALL and it almost damaged my 1200$ laptop. The USB receiver came out in pieces at a time and I'm not sure if it even functioned properly to begin with. It most definitely doesn't function now.,78,1.0,2020,04,April,14
Its a nice blinking nightlight...and that is about it,9,It seemed fine at first but then i tried to type the @ sign eventually I figured out it was on another key not great if your only using it for gaming its a good keyboard (if you using chat it wouldn't be great),44,1.0,2020,03,March,26
"Good keyboard, dies fast with no warning and doesnt work thru charging cable",13,Keyboard did not want to work even after turning it on and off and restarting my computer USB was plugged in but i could not type a word I even tried charging it and still nothing and i just got it today. When I went to settings it showed the keyboard was there but wasn't allowing me to type or even change the brightness of the lights on keyboard,69,4.0,2020,04,April,13
Terrible battery life,3,Good quality,2,4.0,2020,04,April,11
Very simple back light keyboard,5,Awesome,1,4.0,2020,04,April,10
Would not buy,3,The keyboard did not function correctly the moment I opened plugged it. Some of the keys just don’t work. I received a broken keyboard and it’s a pain to return due to Covid-19.,33,1.0,2020,04,April,08
Not completely cordless,3,"A solid keyboard for the price. The battery life is not very good and if you use your computer a lot, it sort of defeats the purpose of it being wireless. The keys are not silent although they are more quiet than most standard keyboards. The backlighting provides a nice visual but contributes to the poor battery life on a single charge; however, the light level makes the keys very visible in a dark or dimly lit room. If the RGBs are important to you, consider a keyboard with more programmability because this one can only switch between off, on, and glow with options to toggle light level and glow frequency.",111,3.0,2020,04,April,07
Highly recommend.,2,"Overall a great keyboard, and rechargeable too. The computer doesnt give you Any warning whatsoever when the battery is low or dead so it might cut out mid-use. Similarly, the battery life isn't stellar, but that's to be expected of a light-up keyboard. Overall a good value at its price point.",51,5.0,2020,04,April,07
Excellent support,2,"I like the raised keys, I’m not using for gaming but for work. What I dislike is that it doesn’t have a setting for backlight to stay on which is what I wanted.",33,5.0,2020,04,April,06
Recommend,1,"I don't use this for gaming and haven't used the sleep mode so can't really rate it. I like the way it lights up and it's a good keyboard. Only issue is I lost the charging cable and can't seem to find a replacement, not even on their website. I do recommend this though.",54,5.0,2020,04,April,06
Would be good but some keys don't work,8,"It's fairly bright, but you're stuck with the one rainbow color pattern, and some of the colors are not as bright as others, making typing in the dark a harder than it should be. The keys are raised up and beveled like a keyboard from 20 years ago, so the striking surface is smaller than on newer keyboards. This makes typing and accuracy a little slower. Some of the keys are placed a little weird, too. The key to the left of the ENTER key usually has the apostrophe and quotation mark. This one has the backslash and vertical line. As I was used to my last keyboard, I kept putting backslashes where apostrophes should be. I'll likely be replacing this soon.",122,3.0,2020,04,April,05
MADE IN CHINA GARBAGE-READ THE FINE PRINT,7,"fast shipped, love it the keyboard!! Works great!!",8,1.0,2020,04,April,05
Everything good except....,3,works great! i only use the usb to connect it to my ps4 and no problems so far using the wireless!,21,4.0,2020,04,April,03

Great keyboard but NOT WATERPROOF...  Read and don't make my mistake :),12,"Great compact keyboard with 10-key.  Easy to type on, not noisy.  Plug & Play setup. Love the colors and breathing effect is very calming.  No issues for me!",28,4.0,2020,04,April,03
STOPPED WORKING,2,I needed a wireless keyboard for a reasonable price and fast shipping PLUS this one brightens my home office. I'd buy it again and again. Happy with my purchase.,29,1.0,2020,04,April,01
Solid choice!,2,Very cool. My 13 year old son loves it. He changes the colors and even turns the color off.,19,4.0,2020,03,March,30
Waste of money,3,This keyboard was easy to set up. However the user manual that you can download is not in English. Use the FN key to adjust the lights. Very cool keyboard.,30,1.0,2020,03,March,30
Good value. Good product. Wish it had macro buttons.,9,I can't trust this keyboard to type read every key I type.  It constantly misses letters and entering hidden passwords are a pain because you don't know if the keyboard even registered the key you hit.,36,4.0,2020,03,March,29
Everything is good,3,Cant use it while its plugged in? I use a laptop so i have little room for usb (mouse and keyboard) and it doesn’t work while its plugged in charging Or atleast thats what ive found,36,5.0,2020,03,March,29
lighting,1,"This is a cool wireless gaming keyboard. I love the fact that it lights up , however it has an internal battery that needs to be charged too often.",29,4.0,2020,03,March,29
quiet keyclicks and great price,5,Purchased this keyboard for looks and for work. It does the job nicely as a regular low demanding keyboard. Haven't game with it yet but I could see it doing just fine. Doesn't feel like a real mechanical keyboard. Feels very plasticy and not the most high-end keyboard out there. The lights only have 2 modes which are breathing and always on. The lights are fixed as the same colors as well. I only bought this since it's cheap and it looks cool. If you want a simple yet cool looking keyboard then this is good. However if you want something a lot more then look elsewhere.,107,4.0,2020,03,March,29
Awesome keyboard,2,Buttons stick. Would not buy,5,5.0,2020,03,March,29
Good service,2,"This is a fair to middling keyboard, the back lighting only works when it is plugged in.. some folks think the back lighting is just a gimmicky bling thing, but in a darkened room its necessary and if you go cordless, no back light! I would rather have a truly cordless model with lots of batteries, I prefer the heft, this one is very light adding to a sense of cheapness. it is compact. still room for improvement. I will try another when I tire of this one, still searching for the one I would re order, this ain't it, but still a reasonable value.",105,5.0,2020,03,March,29
good quality so far,4,"Great product, I have nothing bad to say about this product worth every penny.",14,5.0,2020,03,March,29
Well worth the money.,4,Had an issue with this after a couple months. Contacted the KLIM support and they were great to work with and replaced the product promptly.,25,5.0,2020,03,March,27
Has a lot of lag.,5,It reached my expectations it's a good products I definitely recommend.,11,2.0,2020,03,March,27
Amazing,1,"Totally deceptive-they raised the price, what a joke! Nothing makes me more mad than when a company puts american flags all over their listing and the label on the box says MADE IN CHINA. Why? Because this is deceptive marketing. Even if the box didnt say this, how do I know? Because the letter E key didnt work and the power switch was stuck. Immediate return-DO NOT BUY.",68,5.0,2020,03,March,24
"Solid keyboard, fair price, would buy again",7,It doesn't have a solid lighting.  Doesn't match my red themed pc/mouse/mousepad setup.,13,5.0,2020,03,March,24
"comfortable to use, high quality",5,Great keyboard. Am able to connect from another room without direct line of sight. Response time is excellent. It does miss a key from time to time but I attribute that to range and signal penetration and it's really not an imposition. But best of all the manufacturer is both very responsive and helpful and also have a great sense of humor.Edit. spilled a little coffee on it today. the keyboard immediately spazzed out. turned it off took it apart and cleaned and dried all of it. still broken. suffice it to say waterproof is not what this is.,99,5.0,2020,03,March,23
Volume control doesn't work,4,Outstanding product and customer service.  Thanks!,6,3.0,2020,03,March,23
Deceptive,1,"This is an awesome keyboard, but what triggered my purchase was that I thought it was water proof.. Not sure how I got that idea... I think some reviews I had read were making a mistake of saying water proof and not water resistant. I had also read 2 reviews on another site that mentioned a silicon sealed internals, and the keyboard has quite a few HOLES in it... They are very well engineered for liquid to run onto and through the keyboard, drying it very quickly. I have 2 INQUISITIVE pet birds that knock stuff over all the time onto my keyboards, and are also fascinatd with stomping around on the keys, seems to be a weird fascination with most larger birds I have seen.. So the idea of a keyboard I could just wash in the sink was AWESOME. Except that it ISN'T. I have ran into a few other people that have made the same assumption and instant destruction of an awesome keyboard as myself. I woulodn't even really call it Water resistant.. The board, the battery, wires, and well EVERYTHING is jsimply placed inside with no covering or anything.. WHile the drainage heoles do help mitigate spill damage, the internal components seem very ill e quiped for moisture of any typ. My keyboard died quite instantly upon wiping it down with a damp rag, a bit on the wet side.. though rung out quite a bit. So, be careful. This was a selling point that somehow got very confusing, which failed upon light testing of the water resistance.",262,1.0,2020,03,March,23
Very nice keyboard,3,"It has been about 5 months and this keyboard completely stopped working.This lights are broken (they don't stay on, and the light fr caps lock doesn't turn on.) Not to mention it won't type whatsoever anymore. I do NOT recommend this keyboard.",42,5.0,2020,03,March,22
Really cool! a bit glitchy after a while.,8,"Works well and as expected. Packaging is nice and is pretty simple plug and play. I do wish it would have a solid back light feature and not just the rainbow / multi colored as I think it would look more professional for an office setting, but other wise Im pleased with it.",53,3.0,2020,03,March,22
Works great!,2,Does not hold a charge for more than a week. Half the time you hit a key it doesn't register. I should not have gone with the cheaper model.,29,5.0,2020,03,March,22
Advertisement lies about backlit effects,5,"Great for ps4. Lacks macro buttons. Looks great, but cant change the light effects.",14,3.0,2020,03,March,21

Great keyboard for work,4,Very quick delivery. Nice keyboard. Simple to setup,8,5.0,2020,03,March,13
Great keyboard for a great price,6,"Product came in a good box along with a humorous company statement. However, everything afterwards was a dismay. The wireless keyboards has a lot of lag. The simplest way to describe it is: I’m a pretty decent gamer and I’m getting owned by noobs because of this system. Don’t even get me started on just using it for daily mundane tasks (check and write emails). The system would lag so much that I would rather write a whole essay in my cellphone and send it that way.",87,5.0,2020,03,March,13
Surprising!,1,"I purchased two of these, one works 95% of the time. I get some ghost keys and missed keys, but it is something I can live with. This second keyboard though, wow, just wow. Maybe half the keys work, at most. I charged it up, tried multiple computers, OSes, etc. Same result, I get maybe half the keys working. It is very random too as to when it happens and which keys. Spend a little extra and get something that is actually worth it and if you are worried about accuracy, buy wired.",93,5.0,2020,03,March,12
"worked okay at first, but then got too laggy to use",11,"I've been using mechanical boards for a while, and I randomly used a non mechanical one that I found in my closet and realized I like it way more. So I went to Amazon to find a better quality non mechanical board and found the Corsair k55 which was $80, but then I saw this board for only $40, so I tried this one out. No complains whatsoever yet. Typing feels great, fast response time, very lightweight and wireless has been flawless.Update: Been using this now for 2 1/2 years, still has no issues and works great",97,1.0,2020,03,March,11
Great keyboard,2,"Honestly couldn't be happier with it. Hadn't heard of the company before, but the receipt of this keyboard made me an instant fan. Quality product at a fair price, and they seem to be sincere in putting customer service first. And it came with metal stickers! One immediately went on my PC. 10/10 will buy more of their products.Update: After a couple of years the charging port broke, but the keyboard was still under warranty and they sent me a brand new one. Absolutely wonderful customer service. Still a 10/10 experience.",91,5.0,2020,03,March,11

Great Buy!,2,Volume control doesn't work On this keypad,7,5.0,2020,03,March,10
Wonderful,1,"This keyboard was great and effective at first, I've had it for about 4 months before it started having connectivity issues. The keyboard is not communicating anymore and the keystrokes are not showing up on my screen. The window to return this item closed 2 months ago, so I'm stuck with this keyboard that I will be recycling. Be wary of this product.",63,5.0,2020,03,March,09
KLIM keyboard is so far been a good thing,9,"I went through a lot of wireless keyboards but this on is right on top  of themThe lights are nice and non-intrusive ,the battery life is long and the keys are quiet.Very nice keyboard for gaming and anything in between.",40,4.0,2020,03,March,09
Good,1,"Overall, I really like the product. The response time is awesome for typing, gaming, and more. I would give this product a solid 4 or 5 stars, however, I only got it in late December 2019 to replace a keyboard I had for 2 or 3 years. I have now had this keyboard for a total of 3 months and already the on/off switch is starting to fail. I have to turn it on and off several times before it will turn on. Sometimes it won't come back out of sleep mode, causing me to have to turn it off and back on again, repeating the process a few times until it finally works. Once it's on, it works great. I honestly expected more out of a product that cost me 50+ dollars. I have had logitec and other brands of keyboards throughout the years and they generally last me a couple of years at least. While I really enjoy this keyboard overall, the short term  time it took for it to start degrading is unfortunate. I am hopeful that mine is just a bad one rather than it being the standard because the range, response time, and lighting on this keyboard is awesome otherwise. I have had 30 and 40 dollar keyboards that lasted longer. The return window ended in January, so I guess I will be looking for a new keyboard that serves my needs better.",238,5.0,2020,03,March,09
Love it!,2,Works as described.,3,5.0,2020,03,March,08

Very good,2,"I am really disappointed with this keyboard. At first it was great, but within a month or two the keyboard started to glitch. Certain buttons do not work when I press them. Considering the price of the product I was happy, but not if it stops working after two months.",50,5.0,2020,03,March,06
It works.,2,Good Keyboard just make sure you do not loose that charger or you will have a hard time charging it.,20,4.0,2020,03,March,06
Impressive,1,Stopped working within a week. I had hoped for better.,10,5.0,2020,03,March,06
Excellent product.,2,This keyboard is not silent. The keys do click not as loud as the other keyboards I’ve had..but this is why I bought it to be soundless. I know keyboards won’t be 100% silent but I can’t tell why they put that in their description when it’s just as loud as other keyboards. Also when you aren’t typing and the lights are showing you can hear a humming sound coming from the board and it doesn’t go away until the lights shut off. I do live the lighted keyboard just wish it a bit more quiet.,96,5.0,2020,03,March,06
Nice keyboard for its price,5,This is a really nice wireless keyboard if you don't need too many bells a whistles. I game on my TV so I sit pretty far away and haven't had trouble with connectivity yet. The rgb is simple but nice and switching between the different modes is easy.,48,4.0,2020,03,March,06
Updated review.,2,"I use this keyboard with my laptop for work. It’s much more comfortable for me to type on than the mall laptop keyboard. Silent and has a good touch. Great reactivity and the lights are fun. I don’t use it for gaming, but as a working keyboard it’s great!",49,3.0,2020,03,March,06
Nice wireless keyboard,3,"Quick and easy set up. Just unbox and plug into USB port then game away. Charging cord is a little short but it does has a Samsung S9 charging port (not sure what type it is, maybe C?) so getting a longer charging cord is no issue. No lag between key presses and was shipped in a good sturdy box with stickers and personal note from company.",67,5.0,2020,03,March,05
So far it's perfect.,4,Use this product for PC gaming it is great! I was expecting issues by now since it was so inexpensive but it holds up well I do recommend this keyboard for any gamer that is looking to go wireless and on a budget!,43,5.0,2020,03,March,05
Good keyboard,2,"I was excited to try a wireless keyboard, and really thought I would like this. Battery life would last about a full day and a half, but it charged fast. The lights made it easy to type at night, which was also a bonus. Typing with it was sort of annoying noisy, but could have forgiven that if the product was actually decent. After a few weeks, the typing just got completely laggy, and every few keystrokes missed. It became impossible to type on. Plugging it in with the charge wire didn't fix the problem, so I switched back to my old wired keyboard. Waste of money for how fast this broke down.",113,5.0,2020,03,March,04
"Great keyboard, amazing seller!",4,Some keyboards have very flat keys and I have a hard time feeling the keys. These are great because the keys are slightly recessed in the middle.,27,5.0,2020,03,March,04
Love it,2,"This is such an excellent product! It’s quiet, it in no way ever bothers my carpal tunnel, and the colors are rich and vibrant. The battery charge lasts for quite some time too.Additionally, the customer service is second to none. My USB dongle sadly disappeared in a move, and they replaced it, free of charge no less, within days of my email to tech support. They provided ample instructions on how to sync the new receiver and even included candy in the package as a friendly touch. I cannot brag enough about how great KLIM is!",96,5.0,2020,03,March,04
Love It,2,"I've hooked this up to my PS4 to use while I'm playing FFXIV, and it seamlessly works to type better than the controller does. I still have to use the controller to get to the chat box, but that doesn't bug me. Love the coloring. Great for use in the dark.",51,5.0,2020,03,March,04

Perfect for office use!,4,"So far, i have been satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend it to others. the one issue is the special cord to recharge the keyboard and the ability to match the lighting to my laptop. I do understand the limits on the battery life that prevent the keyboard from staying active all the time but I would like to be able to dim the keyboard when inactive but with the light still bright enough or at least a marker key to engage the lights to make it easier to see in the dark. It may be a little nit picky but the purpose of the lights is to allow me to see and enjoy the back-lights while playing and not have to stop and turn on a light just to re-orient my self to the keys while trying to immerse myself in a game.",145,5.0,2020,03,March,02
Range just isnt there,4,"I'd buy it again, it looks nice and feels nice.",10,2.0,2020,03,March,02
Simple,1,I got this to use at work because wireless works a lot better for my desk set up. I've had no issues and backlight is great. Charge lasts around 1 1/2 to 2  weeks using on a regular work day schedule. The keyboard is pretty quite and is responds with a decent speed.,53,5.0,2020,03,March,01
Great keyboard,2,"Personally,  I would prefer if light stay up longer, or I can extend that some how. I know it will drain battery,  but I would just charge more often.But besides of that I LOVE IT!!!",35,5.0,2020,03,March,01
One of the best keyboards for the money and shipping was very fast!,13,"New update:  Of all the damn products I have bought, I did not buy an extended warranty for this product.

I WANT MY MONEY BACK...Granted they are NOT the clacky mechanic keys, but CLOSE. I guess I need membrane keys. I will try to take a 1 handed video later, but every time I hit the spacebar, HOLY CRAP.  the damn noise. It's my fault. I was getting away from paying $99 for another Logitech keyboard that only glows dim white (I like the pretty colors this one has)  BUT when you put ""silent"" in  the description, it BETTER be silent.",161,4.0,2020,02,February,29

Great keyboard for the price,5,This keyboard is pretty cool but it doesn’t seem to hold up to my son’s gaming. We had to return it for a new one in the first month. The second one seems to be working fine with no issues. I think it is not for serious gamers. It will be fine at a desk where it doesn’t get moved a lot.,62,5.0,2020,02,February,29

Awesome piece for the cost!,5,"Only thing I don’t like about it is that the cable included in the package is ONLY for charging, rather than for charging and wired use.

"Love the design, the lights and the way the keys feel.",11,"UPDATE! Changed my review from five stars to 3 stars. It stills holds charge but the num lock keeps turning off and when I hit it it makes me push the key about four times before it turns on again and now it has a huge lag.

Pretty good,2,"Amazing value, I was worried about the input delay playing games like DotA or Tarkov but there is honestly no delay. It could also be that I'm not a pro gamer by any means and I'm just not good enough to notice it. Either way 10/10.",46,4.0,2020,02,February,26

Great for gaming!,3,Fftttt,1,5.0,2020,02,February,04
Pleased,1,"My office desk has a slide-out tray for the keyboard, and this keyboard is perfect for that because of its slim design... there is no wasted space. I had to replace a more expensive keyboard for that reason, and I actually like this one much better. The only complaint I have is that the Caps Lock key is apparently where my fingers and brain feel like the Shift key should be. Hopefully I will adjust to that.",77,5.0,2020,02,February,17
Works just right - had to order another after the first one didn’t work properly,15,"This is my first wireless keyboard in life...and I LOVE IT!! The standby time is outstanding.  The battery life is superb!! I love how the keyboard lights up with different colors as well.  I have NOT experienced any LAG or disconnection of the keyboard from my PC while using it.  While in idle if a key is pressed it immediately connects without a problem.  Great product, definitely would recommend it to others!!",72,5.0,2020,02,February,16

Great product and great value,5,"I bought this for the office to have as something different, I love that the keyboard and mouse are rechargable, totally what sold me on it but would be nice the lights would stay on longer before timing out and if there were more options for the light.......like maybe blinking or running back and forth or even blink multi color or even different solid colors to pick from along with the different light options (blink, flash, fade, etc..)..... other than that overall a good product.... thank you",87,5.0,2020,02,February,15

Works Great,2,"Overall I love the build and the color and feel of the keyboard but I do not like the style of the enter key. Instead of a tall enter key, it would be better and more comfortable to have the long enter key (like most standard keys)",47,5.0,2020,02,February,07

Great Value,2,"I got this keyboard to use for streaming, as I frequently need to move my keyboard depending on if I'm gaming or using my desk space for my stream. So far I really like it! The keys have good resistance, but are not overly noisy. The color on it is great and not distracting. My only small complaint with the keyboard having the backslash key next to the enter key, as I'll frequently be trying to hit enter and hit that key instead because of the odd shape of the key. But other than that I have been very impressed with this keyboard, especially at the price point!",108,5.0,2020,02,February,07
Exactly what I wanted and customer service is great!,9,"This is EXACTLY the keyboard I was looking for. Soft keys press easily, wireless and the rainbow lights are a bonus. I got thro keyboards about every 2 years. Next time, I will not have search for what I want because I will definitely be buying this one again. They do not last forever and now that I know exactly what works the best for me, I will go to this keyboard again and again, for all future purchases.

Does everything well at a good price,7,"3 stars because like others experienced, Left CTRL+SHIFT does not register with all keys. Guessing they didn't map all of those or something. Alternative I use is Left CTRL Right SHIFT. If you don't use this key combo often then this is a fantastic product.",45,5.0,2020,02,February,05
Quality made,2,"I've been using this keyboard for about three months, and I've only had to charge it about twice, using it about 3+ hours a day. It's definitely not the best ""gaming"" keyboard, but for the price I would say a good buy.",42,5.0,2020,02,February,03
Great,1,Great product,2,5.0,2020,02,February,03
"Not quiet, but otherwise fine",5,"Keyboard is directly as advertised. It responds fast with no lag. The ability to change some of features using FN is just an added bonus. Keys are very comfortable, I honestly, like gaming on it better than the expensive gaming keyboards. Works very well for me.",46,1.0,2020,02,February,03
"Too wide for my use, but great gaming keyboard",9,It is lite-weight works well so far.  But I only have it for a week.I will post back in a month..  I have been using it for about 6 weeks. I need to charge it every 10-12 days.  That is a bit faster then I would like.  The reason I dropped this from five stars to fours stars is it dies boom good then bad when it needs the charge. I don't like to be surprised by a working keyboard then a dead one without a warning.  When it works I like it I like the feel and find it nice for blogging.  But I could be writing here.  Then dead almost instantly.  This means I have to keep track of when to charge it.  I have to work a bit extra to not get caught off guard .  I will come back and review it in six months.I hope the battery keeps taking a charge. i am thinking this was not my best choice I use it 3-4 hours a day. Not typing constantly but still hitting the keys fairly often. It is lit night to day and the charge runs down fairly quickly.  I wish it had a larger battery.  My fear is it will not take a charge after six months use.If you are going to type a lot and constantly don't buy this.,227,4.0,2020,02,February,03
Works great for gaming,4,I purchased two different keyboards and after trying both this one won hands down.  It is so comfortable to use and stunning to look at.  I use it for every day use and it’s perfect.  I highly recommend it.  Every time I sit down to use my computer when I hit that space bar I smile. It’s really cool.,59,5.0,2020,01,January,31
Amazing battery life,3,"Keyboard is great, functions as promised. The follow-up email was truly helpful as many of us do not read the instructions, the key instructions were in the email and made the keyboard even more functional.One improvement that i feel would be nice: being able to change the color of the lighting mainly to all one color.",56,5.0,2020,01,January,30
Great keyboard!,2,"Awesome product was carefully retrieved from our inventory with sterilized anti-bacterial gloves and placed on a satin silk cushion. A team of 50 experts then proceeded to inspect your product, they polished it until it shone bright and bid it farewell with a tender caress … then delivered quickly using two Euro Fighter to escort and insure its safe arrival. Upon inspection, I understood why KLIM took so much care and pride to provide this kool gaming keyboard. Have enjoyed using it right out of the box without any problems. KLIM offered me email support to answer any question about using their product. My only question is, How did they managed to evade our F22s. Thanks! PaulTip: The KLIM Chroma Wireless has 3 light modes: breathing, constant and off. You can change it by pressing ""FN + Pause Break"". You can also increase the luminosity by pressing ""FN + Page Up"" and decrease it with ""FN + Page Down""!",159,5.0,2020,01,January,29
Great quality. Awesome lights. He loves it!,7,This keyboard is great. I needed a keyboard that was wireless and backlight. I am not far from my laptop so I cannot comment on the orange.

Inexpensive but good,3,"I really like this keyboard and so far it lives up to all of my expectations.  I didn't but it for gaming, but rather to replace a work keyboard that I hated to type on.  I enjoy the lighted colors, the numeric keypad and the easy set up with a little dongle to plug in and you're ready to go.  I also believe that customer service moving forward will be very good.",72,3.0,2020,01,January,21
The battery last a long time,6,"I like everything about it except the CTRL+ commands seem to go haywire on my Macbook! The Ctrl, Windows, and Alt buttons all sometimes seem to function in the same way, but it's not consistent. One works to copy, another works to paste.

Keyboard success,2,"Garbage! Returning it. Volumn keys do not work. Light is underneath the keys and do not light up the letters, numbers, and symbols. Printing on keys are too small and unreadable unless you have very young eyes. Returning it!",39,5.0,2020,01,January,08

Worthless printing on keys. Keyboard is for kids who have young eyesight,12,"I was really interested in this because it markets itself as ""quiet"". And let me tell you, if I never needed to use the space bar, it would be very, very quiet. However, as most modern languages call for spaces between words, this keyboard is incredibly loud. If you so much as LOOK at the space bar, it clacks. It's probably the only thing you can hear from my desk as every other key is so silent. The space bar RUINS the rest of the key board. No connectivity issues, the time out is fine, battery is fine, keys work great. But gosh DARN is it loud. I don't know if it's going to stop bothering me at some point, I'm trying to give it time, but I may have to just scrap this keyboard and try a different brand. I'd say spend your money elsewhere as this is beyond annoying.",151,1.0,2020,01,January,13
Don’t lose the cord that comes with it lol,9,"I purchased this keyboard for use with my gaming machine, using it upon my lap in a chair with arm rests. It doesn't fit within the boundaries of the arm rests which causes me to be partially rotated to the left to even try and use it. Wish the keys were more centrally located for my back's sake!Great backlight which dealuminates after use. Keys are a bit clunky, an overreach for that satisfying tactile response producing labored finger extension while using.  Wish they would send me one without the number pad as not to interrupt the use of my main machine, which I use hours every day!",107,5.0,2020,01,January,13
Update: stopped working altogether after 3 weeks. Pure garbage,9,Awesome keyboard for gaming at this price,7,1.0,2020,01,January,12
Useful addition,2,"Have had this key board for about a month now and only had to charge it one time after the initial charge while having the pulsing effect on.  Although I do not type long messages out like this all day long, I do use the key board pretty frequently. Switches feel extremely smooth as well. Will update again for its use in the long term.",65,5.0,2020,01,January,12
Great for my needs,4,"This keyboard is awesome! Does not require batteries as it is a rechargeable keyboard which is cool. Came with the usb c cord. So awesome. Lighting is great and I really like the size of it, great buy! ;)",39,5.0,2020,01,January,12

Works great,2,"I've never had to charge it for the few weeks i used it. The lights cant change i dont think, but it doesnt matter to me. The wireless range is good enough as well, keys feel nice. It sleeps when idle, and i find the wakeup very responsive. i havent had any issues with this. Havent really used the various function keys, and never gamed with it (i use controller anyway) but for what i do it works perfectly.",79,5.0,2020,01,January,11
Totally worth it,3,For computer use into the evening hours...very nice and functional to have a lighted keyboard.,15,5.0,2020,01,January,11
Lit,1,"Had it for a week and it was great until it started just randomly inputting keys and became unusable, DO NOT BUY.",22,5.0,2020,01,January,11
"Quick ship, good product",4,"Some standard hotkeys don't work with the left shift button. I'm disappointed, but I want to like this keyboard. The company refunded me, then I ordered another one cause it's a neat keyboard and I'd hoped the problem was a fluke--nope, same problem on the second one.Specifically, Ctrl + LEFT shift + any of the following: P, O, I, U, Y, H, N, M, do not work on this keyboard. If you normally use ctrl + RIGHT shift + any key, I suppose you won't notice a problem. But for me I first noticed it trying to select inverse in photoshop (ctrl+shift+i), and found the other problems using a keyboard ghosting tool.Aside from that problem I like this keyboard, but it really touts ""anti-ghosting"" stuff so I did not expect this kind of problem. It might not seem like a big deal but it's easier for me to just use a different keyboard than re-learn decades old muscle memory, and who knows what other key combinations are faulty.",168,5.0,2020,01,January,11
Ddsdd,1,That is perfect~ Thank You:),5,5.0,2020,01,January,11
Great keyboard,2,"I purchased this item because of the backlighting. I planned to use it in our living room at night to interact with our TV. The backlighting is great. I like the feel of the keyboard.But yesterday I connected it to my desktop.  I was having problems when I would hit the return key with my left pinky. After comparing the KLIM with the worn out Logitech I am replacing, I found that there is an extra key between the quotation mark key and the Enter key! The backslash key has been moved down a row!If I were a hunt and peck typist, I suppose this would be fine. But I learned to touch type 55 years ago.  I use my touch typing skills many times a day. Why would I want to teach myself how to find the Enter key all over again?! To press a key, thinking that I am using the Enter key and then finding that I have a backslash, or that the item failed to load is maddening.I dislike giving a low score to such a good looking keyboard. But if buyers have the same concern as I do, they need to know what they are buying.I would also prefer a larger delete key.",208,5.0,2020,01,January,11
Exactly what I was looking for,6,"This was a great buy, but reason I gave it 3 stars is it doesn't have a very long range to operate in. You can only go about 6 feet before you lose connection.",34,5.0,2020,01,January,11
Stopped working after two months.,5,There isn't anything that I don't like about. I like it very much.,13,1.0,2020,01,January,11
Worth the buy. Son's loves it. Bought for PS4 gaming,10,If your buy it to play in the dark like I did it is worthless. I put it back in the box. I use a steering wheel and button box so I don't use key Keyboard all the time but when I need to I have to turn a light on to see what key to hit. I'd send it back if I could and get one that stays lit until I turn it off. Useless to me  for playing in the dark.,83,5.0,2020,01,January,10
Easy to use.,3,"This is rechargable and therefore not wireless. It must be plugged in to a wire in order to recharge. This is a huge pain to have to deal with connecting it and tripping over wires, etc, for hours while it recharges, compared to just swapping out some AA batteries in a few seconds.",53,5.0,2020,01,January,10

Awesome Keyboard!,2,"This is a regular keyboard, light weight. Works ok. NOT good for gaming, it drops signal, signal is intermittent and/or keyboard light turns off quickly.",25,5.0,2019,12,December,23
Great for gaming,3,"Update: after about 3 weeks of use, it just completely stopped working. I've been using it plugged into the computer via the charger because the wireless connection is so inconsistent. But today when I got home from work, it's just not working. Didn't get it wet, didn't drop it, etc, can't think of any reason for it to just randomly stop working, but it did. Wireless or plugged in, the keyboard still lights up with the rainbow color, but doesn't acknowledge any key strokes, caps and num lock don't light up, and my computer just keeps saying ""device not responding"" when I try to manually connect it. Don't throw your money away, buy a functional keyboard from a reputable brand, not some shoddy Chinese company with positive review bots.Original: This keyboard has some sort of timer so it will turn off when it's not used. It's about 10 seconds when it's plugged in (it comes with a ridiculously short USB cable, maybe 2 feet long), and 3 seconds or so when being used wirelessly. When it automatically turns off, it takes anywhere from 2-15 seconds to turn back on and reconnect to Bluetooth before it starts registering keystrokes again. It's a constant annoyance that makes most games frustratingly unplayable, and I can't figure out any way to disable it. I really can't recommend this to anybody, it truly makes games unplayable, and any other computer activity annoying and frustrating with a lot of wasted time waiting for it to reconnect. I'm gonna have to return this garbage and get a new wireless keyboard.",263,5.0,2020,01,January,06

Operates within normal parameters,4,For some reason I thought this took batteries but it doesnt. It has an on board battery that takes USB-c to charge. No big deal I have a note 9 and keep a charger at my desk. I got it because its waterproof and I work in a bar. Accidents happen. Haven't used that feature yet but I'll update if I do.

Missing a letter on the keyboard,6,The keyboard looks and works great.,6,4.0,2019,12,December,27
It isn't that bright,4,This keyboard is deceptive! It's really pretty and feels good to use but in about 3 months of use it started having response issues. I use it for gaming and it would randomly stop responding or lag for a few seconds to minutes before recovering. It does this regardless of charger status and even when plugged in. I used it directly next to the receiver and on different machines so it isn't the Bluetooth on my end or distance affecting it. I think either the keys lose responsivity or the Bluetooth signal is losing connection.,95,5.0,2019,12,December,27
"For the price, easily 5 stars.",6,"I love the back lighting,rechargeable battery and light. I personally only sit at a desk when playing games.I mostly like wireless so i don't have to sit at a flat surface for the keyboard use. I like to sit back from my computer on 42 inch monitor TV for emails,you tube videos and browsing the internet while holding the keyboard only when changing websites. Your design makes that harder to pick up or hold with the left hand and typing with the right.The keys go to the very edge of the unit only the bottom and right top corner have a spot to use a thumb to hold without touching a key a little more area on right side would be ideal for many users comfort when holding the board especially near the Esc key,an another model perhaps flared out going to the top..",144,5.0,2019,12,December,27

Exactly what I expected. Thank you.,6,"This is the best wireless keyboard I’ve ever bought. I know ppl complain about slow response of the keyboard, but if you change the settings for it, you’ll get better results!!! My boys play games on my laptop and this keyboard responds quickly to all the commands required to play the games!!!Amazing keyboard for an affordable price! Love the colors!!! Love the fact you can change the intensity of the glow!!",71,5.0,2019,12,December,23
Bluetooth - Great!,3,It's not mine but my son got it for Christmas and he really likes it over the xbox controller.,19,5.0,2019,12,December,23
Pretty much what it advertises,5,"I have been using this keyboard for about 3 or 4 days now and so far it works really well for it's intended purpose. I love the way that the keys feel and that the lights look when I am typing. That being said, there are a few things that knocked this keyboard down to only 4 stars. The first is that while the keyboard is advertised as being silent, this is not the case. In fact, I have found that some of the keys that are more commonly used such as the ENTER key or the spacebar are actually louder than the rest of the keys. For me this hasn't been a huge deal, but I can see how people would be upset if they bought it with the intention of having a quiet keyboard. The second thing is that the LED lights are not as bright as I would have wanted. In the dark, they stand out perfectly and look amazing. However, in daytime or brighter lighting, the lights are hard to see and draw away from the overall aesthetic of the keyboard.",185,4.0,2019,12,December,21

Wouldn’t buy again,3,Easy to use.  Great to go wireless.,7,2.0,2019,12,December,18
Great,1,I have been using this keyboard for almost 2 and a half months and at first I issues with finding the on/off switch for turning on wireless and had to have both plugged into my computer for wireless and charging. After I found the switch on the back it made everything easier and more convenient. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good wireless keyboard with a long battery life.,72,5.0,2019,12,December,17
"The right shift, enter, and backslash keys are in the wrong place",12,"2 big design problems: 1) the lights don't stay on, probably to conserve the battery. This means if you are not using the keyboard for a few seconds, say you are just using the mouse, or just reading the screen, the keys go dark. Then you can't see whatever key you need to hit first when you are ready. 2) The Enter key is one key farther to the right than a standard keyboard. As a life-long touch-typist, I now am tying ""\"" when I mean to hit enter. So not only did I not gain the ability to see the keys in the dark, but I lost the expected location of the enter key.Just a couple of points of clarification: 1) you cannot change the colors. You can just adjust the brightness of the backlighting, and you can put it on some weird ""breath"" setting where it slowly goes brigher and darker. 2) This does not take ""batteries"" like most wireless keyboards. It actually requires a wire to charge the built-in battery, which is billed as taking 4 hours to charge for 17 hours of usage. Might as well leave it connected. So much for ""wireless"".",197,1.0,2019,12,December,17

Battery Dirability,2,Works great. Great value for the money.,7,4.0,2019,12,December,16
Reliability issues,2,"I got this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and couldn't be happier for $30. This has a good set of lights and it comes with a built in battery that charges via usb. My husband loves it and at $30, it was a steal and I'm a customer for life now. The only minor thing about this is that it sleeps a little too fast, but any key waking it up, makes that almost null.",78,1.0,2019,12,December,16
Nice keyboard,2,"This was purchased for a PC that occasionally gets used for gaming but nothing intensive.  On the like side is the backlit keys which are multi colored and bright and readable when all other lights are out in the room.  Something I have struggled to find in other purchased keyboards.  Second is the sleep mode which immediately responds when a key is depressed bringing the keyboard back to life and recording the initial keystroke to the screen.  I have a Mid-high Corsair that cannot do that at 4 times the price tag.  And battery life is way longer than the more expensive Corsair.  My only dislike is the change the manufacturer made in the ENTER/RETURN key.  All of my other keyboards without exception have a horizontal return key.  This one has moved the  key with the forward slash mark ( \ ) to the row next to the quotation marks key allowing the return key to be vertical rather than horizontal.  For a touch key typist, this creates a problem since the pinky finger now has an additional full key width space to cross to get the return key it did not have with other keyboards.  For gamers this is an acceptable, inexpensive keyboard and well worth the money.  For a touch typist, you might want to pick something else as the change in the return key is very frustrating.  This is an update from original initial review. Device did not last a year and stopped working altogether. As did the expensive corsair.  I have gone back to a good WIRED keyboard.",262,4.0,2019,12,December,16

I don't game a lot on it but haven't noticed any input delay while playing FPS. My only gripe is the sleep mode is annoying because you can't see the keyboard at all when it turns off. I'm sure you can change it up just haven't bothered looking into it yet. Lightweight and sleek, a keeper for sure.",72,5.0,2019,12,December,09
Poor product.,2,I thought it was battery operated but I didn't read the description well enough. It lasts about 3 days between charges.  At least I can see the keyboard without the lights on. I'm happy with it.,36,1.0,2019,12,December,05
The Worst,2,"Really don’t care for this product. It seems to constantly be acting up. For example, I was just trying to type an address and all my numbers appeared as if I had been holding the shift key (#%^*).",38,1.0,2019,12,December,04

Great,1,"If you're a touch typist, expect to be slowed down and make a lot of mistakes, because the Enter key is much further to the right than any other keyboard I've ever used.  Because of this, this keyboard is very uncomfortable to use.The keys resist a bit, but bounce back slowly.  It's very easy for a fast typist to get letters out of order, because they keyboard just isn't responsive enough.I don't see how anyone would accept this as a gaming keyboard.",82,5.0,2019,12,December,03

Really bad product.,3,"Less than 2 months after receiving my keyboard, it stopped working. The on-off switch on the back of the keyboard seems to have something to do with the problem. The keyboard stopped working a couple of weeks after the 'return window' closed, so I was referred to KLIM directly. Long story short, KLIM never resolved the issue, despite the fact that this product has a warranty. I sent about 4 emails before giving up. I would definitely not recommend the product. When I purchased the keyboard, I was excited about the features described, but if the product doesn't function, then those features are useless.

Great product,2,"Update: reorganized the living room and it seems that the wireless signal improved a lot. Corners seem problematic for the dongle.With a good direct line of sight it works well.-I really like the look and the fact that the enter key is large (ISO layout) the key between Z and left shift is missing tho. Not sure whether it should be there anyway.Packing is nice and adds emotional value :) . The USB charging cable is a little too short.The bad news is, if it is not close enough to the dongle it fails a lot.After it goes to sleep it sometimes wakes up unresponsive, you get key double presses and lost keystrokes randomly. Copying pasting and cutting can be a chore because you don't know if the keyboard sent the Ctrl+x or Ctrl+v appropriately.If you figure out how to keep a steady 2.4g link between the keyboard and transmitter you're all good.I wish there was a way to know how much battery is left.If you're ok spending more on a keyboard, go for the pro stuff. If you're on a budget it's a good pick.P.s. Dear Klim guys, I like you. Try improving connectivity for solid reliable wireless performance and showing battery usage",204,5.0,2019,11,November,01

It felt great, looked cool and was super comfortable to use.. Plus I liked the backlit lights of course. So.. This is my reasoning for buying it and it did not disappoint. I have used it for a few weeks now, love it and will stick to this brand and style of keyboard from now on.",127,1.0,2019,10,October,03
Good For the Price,4,This keyboard is great! I'd you want a wireless keyboard ranging from gaming to office work this is the one for you.The only downside I can think of is it's not bluetooth but other than that ita fantastic!!Now stop thinking about getting it and just get it.,47,4.0,2019,10,October,02
Good purchase,2,"I bought this keyboard so I could see the keys as I write in the evening and at night. This lightweight, soft keys, keyboard has great backlighting with multiple colors that flash the light gently in the background as you type.  When the keys are not in use, the backlighting turns black (off), therefore, sparing the user the time it would need to charge it. There is also an on/off button that is optional, as well.  I am able to use this keyboard swiftly, and quietly with no problem.",89,5.0,2019,10,October,02

Quite,1,"I love this keyboard. The keys are super quiet and it’s comfortable to type on. It’s great having the colors as opposed to a simple white backlight. I only have two issues. First, I do with the colors were a tad bit brighter. Second, I would like a way, say a downloadable software, to control the brightness as well as how fast the colors fade, or not at all even, and lastly how long before sleep mode kicks in. For the price though you definitely can’t complain, and frankly I feel my issues are very minor.",96,5.0,2019,09,September,22
Thoroughly average keyboard - it works,6,"Horrible. The first keyboard that I got had a dysfunctional key. They did do a good job of replacing it. However, the battery ran out and then the charger didn't work. As it happened, UPS didn't do a good job of picking up the old keyboard so I still had that charger. Neither charger worked. Awful.

Good keyboard,2,On time delivery and nice quality,6,5.0,2019,09,September,19
Very Quiet and a Tad Dark,6,"The keyboard itself as a keyboard works fine.  However there are a few things that need improvement.1. The backlight needs to be brighter and the individual keys need to stay lite up even when the backlight fades out.2. Need to give the user the option to select to keep the back light on constantly instead of just fading or off.  I'm a user that likes the back light to stay on, I'm not a fan of the fading in/out as it makes it hard to see the keys in the dark especially if trying to find numbers and symbols.3. The Enter key is too far to the right for a comfortable typing selection.  Meaning, that the Enter key should be where the \ key is.  Normal U.S. keyboards have the Enter key closer in this position so when typing we easily select the right key but you have the \ key where the Enter key should be so it interferes and causes us to hit the wrong key.4. The keyboard isn't that quiet, hitting the keys when typing softly the keys still make a lot of noise.",187,4.0,2019,09,September,19
It was s present,4,"It's an OK product for the most part. There are a few things that I noticed that lead me to give this product only 3 stars.1. The sleep time on the led feature is too short and not adjustable. It turns off the led lights after about 20-30 seconds and if you're trying to use it in the dark this defeats the purpose of getting an illuminated keyboard. There should be an ability to leave it on.2. The brightness on the led lights is not very good. In a completely dark room it may be passable but in a room with partial illumination like a lamp or even the light from your TV/Monitor screen, the keys get a little lost and not easy to see since they blend with the glare from the screen.3. The chroma colors make such a dimly lit product that much harder to see, and you can't adjust this. It would be better if you could make it just green, white or blue lights but the chroma color runs across the keyboard and the red color is very dim. To top it off, the leds are so far under the keys that you get more of a halo effect around the underside of the key than lighting up the key characters themselves.The only pros I have about this product are1. the price, cheap for what it is.2. the quiet no click of the keys (perfect if someone else is in the room trying to sleep)3. USB-C charger compatible.Aside from the things I mentioned at the top of this post. There are some extras that could have made this product better.1. Dedicated buttons for FF, REV, PLAY/PAUSE & VOL UP/DOWN, Mute. Having to constantly press a function button for basic features like those when you want to control music or volume is annoying.2. Removable rechargeable batteries you can replace and charge in the unit when the charger is plugged in. I had a mouse that did this and it was a great feature, and when the battery could no longer hold a charge, I just replaced it.3. The 2.4 ghz dongle is awesome, but also having a Bluetooth option can make this better and able to connect to devices that don't have USB ports, but keep the dongle.I'm not happy with mine, I will return it and spend a little more on a better solution for me.",400,5.0,2019,09,September,19

Great deal,2,I like that you have the option to have the lights pulse in and out or keep it solid. The keyboard does go dark if you don't touch the keys (energy efficient I'd say). The best part is how quiet the keys are! Definitely worth the price.UPDATE: I lost the USB receiver for the keyboard and contacted KLIM directly. They sent me a new USB receiver for free!

Lights turn off automatically after a few minutes,8,"This keyboard is thoroughly average.  You press keys, and the computer reacts.  There are no glitches.  The backlight turns on, so you can see the keys in the dark as advertised--unless it goes to sleep.There is nothing to set this keyboard apart.  In fact, it is lacking in some ways.  For example, there is no way to determine how much batter power you have left, which is inexcusable for a wireless ""gaming"" input device.  There is nothing worse than discovering your keyboard is dead in the middle of a gaming session.  They did not even need to write software to display this information.  Windows 10 can display it if the device simply provides it.I am also not a fan of the key layout.  They got creative with the placement of the backslash key.  Instead of being in its normal position above the enter key, they pushed the quote key to the left and jammed backslash in between that and enter.  Enter has been stretched up to backspace.  The end result is that if you try to type backslash or pipe characters, say when entering paths or escape characters or coding, you wind up hitting the Enter key instead.  Possibly 5-6 times since you're typing without looking, on instinct.  I don't know how many times I have tried to type in a path an inadvertently submitted the wrong path to the OS by pressing enter instead of backslash.  Very frustrating.  The quote key being shifted to the left is also very annoying, but not quite as bad.  If you are a developer, this keyboard will slow you down for this reason alone--particularly if you then go to work and use keyboards with a standard layout.  Maybe others are different, but the absolute last thing I want in a keyboard is a less-than-standard key layout.  It renders useless years of accumulated intuition and experience.",312,3.0,2019,08,August,31
What a fun keyboard!,4,"The keys are very buggy in response.  Takes hitting the keys several times in some instances for them to work.  Keyboard goes into sleep mode seconds after you hit a key.  So it is constantly turning off forcing you to jam the keys to get them to work again.  It is pretty and the company sends you cute emails after you buy it, but just a garbage product overall.  I have had to buy a new keyboard just 2 days after purchasing this one as it id border line unusable",90,5.0,2019,08,August,31

This does just the trick and is just more comfortable and quicker for me to type on than those tiny keyboard attachments for controllers. My only small complaint as others have mentioned is some colored keys are easier to see than others.  But overall it hasn't been a significant issue and serves its purpose.",77,5.0,2019,08,August,30

As described,2,The keys are very quiet and the LED's add a nice touch to the office.  However for typing occasionally I do look at the keyboard to ensure of my hand placement is correct or to look at the key pad to punch numbers.  The downside is that the keys are pretty dark themselves so tough to see at a glance.  Overall happy with my purchase.,65,4.0,2019,08,August,29

BEST KEYBOARD EVER!!!,3,"UPDATED Used to be 3 stars. Now 1. I find the lighted keyboard distracting, but when I turn the light off, I can't see the characters on the keys. I had to buy stickers for the keys so I could use the keyboard without the light on. This hopefully will help my second issue, which is having to recharge the thing when it starts misbehaving. Wireless ought to mean no need for wires! I would prefer batteries. Easier to replace batteries every couple of months than to recharge every week. Otherwise the keyboard is fine. UPDATE The mouse in this combo became laggy after about a month, taking a second or two to respond when I used it. That lag has increased to the point that today I am still waiting for my cursor to respond an hour after booting up. New battery made no difference. Useless!

Nothing,1,"When I turned it on and the back lights appeared in a beautiful rainbow pattern, I was blown away.  It is such a nice keyboard.  I am definitely impressed with this product upon first receipt.What I love best about the product is everything, really.  The keys are soft and comfortable. With the exception of the space key, I love how quiet these keys are. I can type discreetly without being too loud.  I love that the lighting is adjustable (both in pattern and brightness). The ""breathing"" mode is a very neat feature and I like that I can adjust the speed of it.  It has a calming effect!  But I also like that I can keep the lights on all the time or even turn them off completely if I don't want them on.  The wireless feature is neat because I can take it anywhere and position it anywhere and don't have to worry about plugging it in.  I like the little legs on the bottom so I can raise the keyboard up or leave it flat  if I want it to be more (or less) ergonomic. The battery display is a great feature because I can tell when I need to plug it in before it loses power.  I also like that the dongle that plugs into the computer has a little nook on the back of the keyboard so they can stay together when not in use.On the instructions pamphlet, at the very end, it says ""Thinks for Reading.""  It should say ""Thanks for Reading.""  It's obvious that great care was taken to create a high-quality product, so it's disappointing to see such a careless error.One other thing I don't care for is how loud the space bar is.  All the rest of the keys are soft and hardly make a sound, but when I tap the space bar, it makes a loud plastic-y sound that seems to resonate throughout the room.  For how often it gets used, I was hoping it would be a bit quieter. Other than those two things, I wouldn't change anything!This product is very easy to use.  The instructions were incredibly helpful and well written.  It's nice to see the instructions written out in so many languages.  It gives the impression that this is a worldwide company and because of that, very successful.  It gives the company a lot of credibility.  The instructions were easy to read and follow.  I like that the ""function"" keys are explained and there is even an illustration of the keyboard with keys labelled so they are easy to find on the real keyboard.I absolutely love this keyboard and I would recommend it to all of my friends.  Whether you have a laptop or a desktop computer, this keyboard is not only great to look at, it works very well. There is an incredible value for the money here.  I have several KLIM products in my office and I love each one.  I am satisfied with this company and will definitely purchase products from them again.",508,5.0,2019,08,August,21
Nice keyboard,2,I bought this specifically because it said it was a quiet keyboard. Not even close. It is no more quiet than a normal keyboard. False advertising and False description of the product. I have a quiet HP keyboard and thought this one would be like that one because of the description. This one went back in the box and I ordered another HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2. Wish I had just ordered another HP in the first place but got fooled by the false description in the headline of this keyboard.,91,4.0,2019,08,August,21

Nice keyboard!,2,"I have to change my review from a 5 star to a 2 star. I had surgery a couple weeks ago so my keyboard sat unused for 2 weeks and getting back to it, it only works about half the time. It either won't type anything at all or it types the wrong thing. Nothing was spilled on it, it is dust free, undamaged, etc... I now realize the lighting up underneath is a hampering problem instead of a good thing because if all it did was light up under the keys, that would be fine, but without the keys having painted on white letters, they're virtually impossible to see and that's a pain in the ass. I wanted to return the keyboard for a refund so I could get a different one, but I apparently passed that window while I was recovering from surgery. Also, I have asked questions of the seller, but they have yet to be answered. So my original 5 star review has now dropped to a 2 star and if this continues over the next week I'll leave a worse review and drop it to a 1 star for customer service alone. I paid for a product and I expect it to work and if it's not going to work, I expect to be able to get my money back so I can find a product that does work. I am an author and a gamer and this has really messed up both aspects.",249,4.0,2019,08,August,20

I can't speak to how long it stays charged or with what kind of use--my keyboard use can be pretty sporadic as it's just for personal use and not heavy gaming or regular work use.  The charging cable is short for my liking; I prefer to plug it into an adapter and not the computer for efficient charging.  The feel of the keys is nice; they press easily but not too easily.  Typing is quiet.  The keyboard is very lightweight, which is nice for someone like me who moves it to charge it and also put it away when not in use.

Bought for PS4,3,"I love this product, it’s a nice design, very light in weight. And does what I want it to do. Charges with ease. I’m happy I got it.",28,5.0,2019,07,July,30
good,1,Great product!!! Some of the coolest features I've seen on a keyboard. Easy to use and set up. The lights are a big hit as well. Simple to set up and use right out of the box. Definitely worth everything penny.,41,4.0,2019,07,July,28
"for people in the ""know""",5,Bought it for my son to use on his Xbox One. He loves it. Works perfectly,16,5.0,2019,07,July,28
Great keyboard when it decides to work.,7,Was not at all what I expected. Seems very cheaply made. My computer started acted very weird when it was installed as I was using it. Maybe this one was just defective but I do not want another one.,39,2.0,2019,07,July,27
"So far, so good.",4,"This keyboard is great. I was using it so quickly. I just plugged in the usb dongle and it was ready to go. The lights are so pretty , and the board is so lightweight, This is easily transportable. It has a switch, which allows you to shut of the lights if you choose. My daughter was so excited when she realized that besides the PC, she could also use on her Xbox. It would actually be great if this could come with multiple dongles so it could be used on more than 1 device at a time. However, it’s so easy to switch that it’s really not such a big deal to do it yourself. It charges really easily too. For the price, this is a good buy👍🏻",129,5.0,2019,07,July,26
Quality of the product,4,To me personally this item looks so 90's however I bought it for a friend and she says it works perfectly and makes her desk area look ALIVE !,29,5.0,2019,07,July,24
Great!,1,"Because the keylighting was not distinctive enough, and because the ""time-out""  was too fast for our preference it did not meet our needs.",23,5.0,2019,07,July,24
My grandson like it,4,Can’t see the letters on the keys.  Lights don’t add any benefit.  Return key is farther away than on most keyboards so end up hitting the / key instead. Very bad choice on my part.,35,5.0,2019,07,July,22
Great product.,2,"This is a neat keyboard! It’s smaller than my old wired one but that’s perfect.  It’s light weight and holds a charge.  I’ve been using it for about a week and have only charged it twice.  It hasn’t gone dead on me so I’m not sure how long it lasts with a full charge, I just need to make sure it doesn’t during gaming.The lights turn off after a few seconds of non use, but I’m sure that’s to save battery.The colors are neat!! I have a lighted mouse pad that lights up with the same colors and it looks pretty cool!All in all, I’m happy with this keyboard so far.",111,5.0,2019,07,July,21

So far so goo,4,used for xbox one,4,5.0,2019,05,May,24
Worked amazing,2,The product is not worth the price because the keys are too big the lights are dimmed and it felt poorly made in general although it worked correctly. 2/5 would spend money elsewhere,33,5.0,2019,05,May,18
"Sometimes, you get more than you pay for",8,"I ordered this after my very old HP wireless keyboard decided to tap out on me with a few of the keys just no longer working at all, & since my family member didn't want to spend the $$$ on a can of compressed air to fix it so I tried a few ways to see if it could be fixed trying a few other tips on my own as it was a a bit grimy/dirty but unfortunately for whatever reason the 4 keys still wouldn't work, so I figured why not purchase a brand new one & after searching on Amazon, my eyes were immediately drawn to this one!To be honest, so far I am really liking this keyboard, especially the colored lighting when it hits nighttime.Talk about a really nifty idea!! So far, I LOVE IT!The one downside I have with this keyboard though is the fact that it has to be charged using a charger to connectto my wireless PC when needed, & unfortunately I'd need to disconnect my separate wireless mouseconnector in order to charge up the battery for the keyboard as my PC only has 2 USB ports on the left side from what I can tell ( as I don't know if it might have a few more USB ports in the very back), which is a bit of a possible small letdown, but I am sure I'll get used to it overtime!With that said, it arrived in a timely & quick manner! I am super excited to begin using it & gonna hope that itwill last as long as it does! =)",269,5.0,2019,05,May,12

Very happy with this purchase,5,"This is the most inconsistent keyboard ever.  It worked fine for the first 2 months but now it only seems to work when it wants to. That's terrible for gaming. You'll be in a game and out of nowhere your character is taking damage and you're like,""What the hell?!"" Ive had this for about 4 months and its already failing on me. I can't recommend this.",66,5.0,2019,04,April,30

Beautiful,1,"The fact that you can't keep the lights always on totally defeats the purpose of buying this product for gaming and night time using. the lights turn off too fast if you are not constantly typing something even at their longest settings.And you can't select just one of the five colors of the LEDs, so you are stuck with the rainbow lights.Also it's not that very quiet compared to an old mechanical keyboard i have, it's only about 10-20% quieter.I hate the fact that I thought i was buying an AMERICAN product because of the American flag on their  main advertising image on it's front page but it's made in China.",111,5.0,2019,04,April,09

These are great!,3,"These headphones are amazing and I love them so much! The noise cancelation is okay, It works but its not as perfect as I thought it would be.

Best headset,2,Now I don't really use my headset to talk to people in game so let me preface this review by saying I have no idea how that works BUT it's perfect for what I need it for which is to have headphones in while I game.

Don't recommend,2,"I thought I would give these a try but the mic is difficult because I have to yell for it to pick up my voice, or I have to mute then unmute for mic to work because randomly it stops.

My mic broke 2 months into use.,7,"This headset is connected to my controller and I use it to play games. There is a mic on/off switch on the headset which I use to mute and unmute myself when necessary. Now that switch does nothing. No matter what position the switch is in the mic doesn’t work. Also, randomly and often there will be a bunch of crackling and humming sounds that is heard by all players online at the moment coming from me.  This happens even with the microphone not working.

VERY COMFORTABLE,2,These headphones are really comfortable. Other headsets that I've purchased sometimes have hurt my head. I can wear these for hours and can't even feel them on my head.

Mic is absolutely terrible!!,4,The sound quality is good for the price but it is not very comfortable headset. All of my freinds were always telling me to get a new mic and I finally understood why after hearing myself on the mic it’s so loud with the most annoying echo. I have to hook up a separate mic if I want to play games with freinds and the headset just isn’t even that comfortable with the mic turn off option mot even working half the time. It’s mostly what you’d expect for the price but I’ve gotten headsets 3x as good for the same price so I do not recommend. I honestly have no idea why this headset is so recommended it really isn’t that great at all.,125,2.0,2022,10,October,23

I still can't believe that they are so good for such an amazing price. The cord is super long, during meetings I can get up and walk around. Noise cancellation is amazingly good.

100% love this thing!,4,I use this for my Xbox partychat never had issue in the past and I've gotten the same one from the same person but the one I got recently seems to be a little staticky so it's constantly in your ears and in somebody else's ears other than that they're okay just static gaming,54,5.0,2022,10,October,14
Works just fine,3,"This is good for its price, but if you want quality, look for some higher costing ones.",17,5.0,2022,10,October,13

Great!,1,"My son goes through headphones quickly (not certain what he does to them) these are holding up well to the abuses of a kid. they have good noise cancelling, because he can't hear me when i try to talk to him. The short fixed boom is wired well and seems to be holding up.",54,5.0,2022,10,October,13
Plastic Crap,2,My son picked this out and loves it. It works well with our playstation 4.,15,1.0,2022,10,October,13

My grandson loves them he was so excited.,8,Games,1,5.0,2022,10,October,12
Pretty good for the price.,5,They are comfortable I was playing with my friend and he could tell the difference from my old ones. But if you want to have the light on you have to plug it up to your console or the wall,40,5.0,2022,10,October,12

Never trust the Bengoos,4,These and the other Chinese brand that are exactly the same are pretty good for the price.  I have owned 3 andnthisnis my 4th pair. Like anything else the cable does eventually good bad at the plug end however every set has lasted me over a year. I think the shortest time frame was about a year and a half and that is using them basically every day for hours on end. Sound is not broadcast quality by any means but it's not terrible either. I have never had any complaints from anyone saying they Sound bad or hard to understand or hear.,103,1.0,2022,10,October,12
Great for the price,4,"Constant thumping, would personally burn or smash",7,4.0,2022,10,October,12
8 year old loves it,5,"One night your headphones break…. And you check Amazon for a new pair of cheap headphones. You may stumble across a pair of nice looking headphones, which are only $19.99 and a whopping 60% discount. Trust me, there is a reason these nightmare bengoo’s are more than half off. You may think these headphones look legit, but once you plug them into your controller, all hell breaks loose. Not only will the legendary bengoos lodge out of your controller about 6 times per minute… if you are ever in a gaming party, I want to say good luck to the other soldiers in that chat. They may think you just bought a new pair of nice headphones, but little do they know they are about to enter the midst of a modern war fare multiplayer lobby. The sound everyone hears when you pop on the bengoos, mirror the sound of a precision air strike happening 24/7 in the mic… one would assume you are in the middle of a war. If you are ever thinking of acquiring a pair of bengoo headphones… make sure you don’t have any friends, because you will lose them very quickly when you destroy their ears in a game chat.I am warning you now. Once you acquire a bengoo… the rest is on you good sir.",221,5.0,2022,10,October,12
Built in mic,3,I use these when playing Xbox online. Very good sound quality!,11,4.0,2022,10,October,05

Decent headphones with false advertising.,5,"I've had mine for 2 years now and the outer ""skin"" on the earmuffs is now peeling off. They still sound great for how much they cost but I'm told the mic doesn't sound very good. I've since switched to another mic but still use this headset and will continue to do so until the earmuffs completely fall apart.",59,2.0,2022,10,October,11
Didn’t work,2,"I don’t know about the quality because I don’t use it, but it was Used by an 8 year old and his 5 year old brother for many months and has not Broken yet. So I know it’s sturdy.",39,1.0,2022,10,October,11
Fantastic,1,These noise canceling headphones do not have hardware and software that is actually known as noise canceling in them. It merely refers to the fact that the headphones go over your ears and do a minimal job of blocking outside noise. These headphones do play noise and it does have a microphone but if you're looking for something that has actual noise canceling tech in it look elsewhere.,68,5.0,2022,10,October,11
Doesnt light up like it states,6,Didn’t work when I first bought it and did t even bother with the refund don’t waste your time go to Best Buy.,23,3.0,2022,10,October,11

It is what it is for the price,8,"Cant hear that well, doesnt light up as stated in ad.",11,4.0,2022,10,October,10
Doesn't work and exposed wires.,5, For the price it’s really amazing it just doesn’t light up how I thought it would connected via just the headphone jack but overall it’s great ! I want to get a pink one as well,36,1.0,2022,10,October,10
"Great device, but feels very cheap",6,You get what you get for its price,8,2.0,2022,10,October,10
Great at first but only lasted 5 months,8,Wires are exposed and the headset doesn't work. Unfortunately the box was thrown out so I cannot return it.,19,3.0,2022,10,October,09
Wouldn’t recommend,2,"The thumbnail makes this look like it is a Class A headset and to it's credit, the sound quality is better than any set of earbuds or headphones that I have ever used. However; the build quality is very poor. It feels cheap. The plastic feels like something that would be purchased in a dollar store. I purchased something that looked similar on here about a year ago and it surprised me in the complete opposite way leading me to believe that you do not need a big brand name or tons of positive reviews to get a good decent product, but I guess lightning doesn't always strike twice. I kept these since it didn't seem worth the hassle in returning them and it is still good to have a backup set, especially one that I don't care about, but if I had a choice to purchase a different pair, I would and I am advising you to do the same.",161,1.0,2022,10,October,09
Perfect,1,"Headphones were great for my son, the ear cushions were comfortable and overall the headphones fit great. The other ones he had started to be too small for him. He loved the lights and to be able to mute the mic from the headphones. On the downside they only lasted him 5 months, at first the mic kept going in and out, them the sound started acting up. Now I have to get a replacement. At least these headphones didn't physically fall apart like others have.",86,5.0,2022,10,October,08
Mic never worked,3,They didn’t work,3,1.0,2022,10,October,08
"These are McDonald’s, I’m loving it!",6,"These are exactly what I was looking for, and I got then half off as well. I would definitely recommend. I have seen that people were having issues with the mic on a Nintendo Switch but it works for me. It works for my PC, Nintendo Switch, and even my phone. The price is cheap but the quality is high. They are also very comfortable, I hate using headphones, but these Gaming Headphones are great for just about everything. 5 stars, hands down.",83,4.0,2022,10,October,08
Not compatible even tho it says it is to PC,10,"Got this as a birthday present. Sounds quality was ok, but the max sound is not very high. I could also never get the mic to work even after about an hour troubleshooting. Would not recommend to other buyers. Spend a few more bucks for something better quality if you plan to game often.",54,2.0,2022,10,October,07
I bought one... then another.,5,Really Cool setup. Only drawback is you have to order a usb adapter separate to use the light function on a ps4.,22,4.0,2022,10,October,07

Cheap Garbage,2,"I bought one of these for my son to replace the old broken one he had.

Buy it!",52,1.0,2022,10,October,07
Not recognized by PC,4,"Decent headphones. My sons both have ordered a pair and while they generally work pretty well they have had a few hangups with them while playing games. Sometimes they have to be plugged and unplugged a couple times before the sound works, and sometimes it just doesn't seem to want to work at all (and yes, the volume is up). But overall they work about 95% of the time and they were pretty cheap, so...",75,1.0,2022,10,October,07
No bueno,2,"The headphones themselves are okay, but the microphone is horrible. It's not flexible or adjustable in any way, so you can't actually get close enough to it to sound better than muffled to anyone else in a voice chat. It sounds like you're speaking through a wad of cotton or from another room. I have no idea how this has gotten so many five-star reviews when the microphone is so so bad.",72,1.0,2022,10,October,07
Wrong color,2,"For some reason this headset would not get recognized by my PC, despite the product saying it is PC friendly. Very disappointed and PCers cautioned!",25,4.0,2022,10,October,06
good for gaming,3,"I use this headset for my PS4 and the microphone doesn’t work. Unfortunately, my friends can barely hear my voice if not at all.

I pray it’ll get better soon..",62,4.0,2022,10,October,06

Needs a $35 adapter for Xbox one,7,"There's a reason these headphones are super cheap.  Because they are.  It comes with USB and 3.5mm plugs so you've got an overabundance of wires to deal with right off the bat.  The mic doesn't go any lower than the image shows so I find myself yelling into the mic to be heard by my team.  And they tell me the sound quality of the mic isn't that good.  When I replace these, I'll spend more money on a higher quality set.",82,3.0,2022,10,October,04
Comfy,1,"Cheap quality, broke within first month of light use",9,5.0,2022,10,October,04
Great! Will keep it!,4,Nice product but It works on everything except for an Xbox one which is what I have. In order to use it with the Xbox one it requires a $34 adapter which was not mentioned in the description,38,5.0,2022,10,October,04

Works great!,2,When you speak the mic sounded like I was under water wasn’t clear. If your not getting this item for a mic I recommend it because the hearing aspect of it is great I can hear everything it’s just the mic is poor,43,5.0,2022,10,October,04
Good but fragile.,3,they look awsome and worked great ... for a month. thats it. wish they had kept working because i liked the look of it it was a present i bought for my husband,33,3.0,2022,10,October,03

pretty good,2,"I bought this for gaming. My dad said “It will be total trash.” But he let me buy it. It came pretty quick. I plugged it up to my ps5 controller and played some destiny 2. The sound was stellar. I then plugged it to my brother's pc and played some Minecraft. Also good. The only problem I have with it is if you don’t have a portable charger, you can’t really use the lights unless you play pc a lot. On the back, there is only one color. A light green. The mic quality is really good compared to an iPad mic. I’ve had it for a few months. Really sturdy. Great for music great for gaming. Great for anything. The noise canceling is not good but for $40 I’d say it’s epic.",134,5.0,2022,09,September,27

So far so good,4,"The sound is really impressive on this headset and I like the sturdy mic rather than a bendy one, you can’t really complain for the price but the mic is mid, it isn’t like a razer mic duh but it picks up your voice just find with minimal background noise.

Great quality,2,This head so it was not that company when I first got it. Well the texture of it feels nice it seems like it doesn’t fit my head right this isn’t that tight on the ears. doesn’t seem noise canceling. Another thing I noticed while using this for gaming is if there are sounds one way you will hear it on all sides with no direction-very hard to use and play competitively. A second issue I have found with this headset is that it is very bad at picking up noise and I have found myself yelling trying to talk to my teammates with them still  barely being able to hear me I returned it and I do not recommend this headset.,122,5.0,2022,09,September,18

HORRIBLE. DO NOT BUY.,4,"The sound quality (both playback and recording) is fine, however I find the earmuff portion of the headset to be a bit too small, as it does not fit around my entire ear (and I don't have particularly large ears afaik.)

Mid sound quality but good first headset,7,The cord is way too long it and it gets tangled up because it is so long and sometimes it cuts out so I can only hear in one ear and I have to fiddle with the cord to try and fix it. The mic cancels most noise but the headset does not cancel any noise and since I have a fan on I can hear it with my headset on and it gets annoying while I’m trying to game.,80,3.0,2022,09,September,10
Very good,2,"Not good at all but I did pay cheap for it.  Uncomfortable, sound is not that good and a short mic. I wouldn’t buy again.",25,4.0,2022,09,September,10

Dont buy these,3,"This product is very disappointing and the advertising for it is suspect. While it states that it is compatible with the Nintendo Switch and X Box One systems, the microphone is not compatible with either, unless you pay and extra $30+ for an adapter to make the microphone work. The worst thing though, is the return window: you have like 3 weeks to return it, then you are stuck with it. I spent two weeks trying to get it to work and figuring out whether it was worth it to pay for the adapter. Now I am stuck with these useless things. Very, very disappointing. It is definitely worth it to pay more money for a better product that is ACTUALLY compatible with the systems it says it is compatible with.",131,1.0,2022,09,September,08
DURABILITY,1,"So the sound quality is pretty great, but the mic seems to be picking up voices from the games I play. I have to lower the dialogue volume (if that is an option, if not I have to turn down the whole game's volume) to get the mic to not pick it up through the headphones. Perhaps if the mic was further away from the headphones, but because it is so short it seems to pick up voices from games or videos really easily.EDIT: So the mute toggle on the cord does not prevent this audio pickup from the mic. It completely stops my voice and sounds from my environment, but it somehow is still picking up voices from games or videos, even when the mute toggle is on.",129,1.0,2022,09,September,07

These are a keeper,4,"Overall underwhelming headset. Given it’s a cheap price sure it could meet your needs. I don’t like that the ear muffs don’t turn so its kind of uncomfortable to wear, can’t imagine wearing these for long periods of time. The chord connector is obnoxiously long, unless this is something you’re looking for. Mic settings/ mute is all basic controls which is expected with a lower price point mic. Overall, not practical for long term use in my opinion. Will be returning.",81,5.0,2022,09,September,07

I haven’t actually played with em but the one time I had them on they seemed pretty comfortable.

No Audio Sound,3,These headphones are nice to look at but the microphone sucks. Most gamers of any level or even someone who needs to use it for Zoom conferences needs a decent quality mic.

Recommended,1,"These lasted just long enough for the return window to close. The sound quality and everything about them were actually GREAT while it lasted. The first thing to go was the mic . I’m guessing it was fine at first then my teammates started to say “ hey your mic is garbage” “ it sounds terrible mute your mic” . . . Then after the mic started going,  the end of the plug is now slipping out of the jack all the time and the sound from the speakers almost is starting to sound “clipping” . If these lasted a year or so I would say great buy but they didn’t . They lasted like a month or less.",119,4.0,2022,08,August,31

So quiet,2,"What I liked about the headphones is they are good for my games. If there is bass or low tones, the headphones feel like they shake a bit. However the headphones are only OK when cancelling noise. I can still hear some vehicles drive by outside. It is my own fault for not reading the description carefully. But what I do not like about the headphones is that they need a USB attachment and you have to plug it in for the lights. The USB thats attached to it as a cord is really short. But over all I like them",101,1.0,2022,08,August,28

Amazing headphones for price,4,It’s good for a pinch. It doesn’t have the best quality. Also it’s not for console gaming. The led lights needs to be hooked up to a USB in order to light up.

USELESS,1,"I just purchased this headset because my old one crapped out on me.  I can hear sounds fine, but even at max volume it's really quiet.  When I tested the mic by doing a short recording in Audacity, it was super quiet and sounded like I was inside a well covered by a blanket when speaking at a normal inside volume.  I used a different program to rectify this kind of.  The mic is now better volume, but still sounds like crap.  I guess it technically does what it's supposed to, but even for only thirty-ish bucks this headset is not great.  Probably just going to buy a different one and keep this one as a backup in case I need it.  The only real pro of the headset is that it's decently comfortable.  Bottom line, I don't recommend this thing.  I've spent less on better quality headsets before.",149,1.0,2022,08,August,20

Bought these for my kid, and like clockwork they broke precisely after the 30 day warranty was up. No sound output at all. Maybe I just have horrible luck, but it seems like if it says Made In China on it and you use it with any type of regularity, it’s gonna take a dump prematurely. These things aren’t work $5.

Cool,1,Does not work with the PS4 and they are not well made. the ear ad came off almost right away and they don’t even work well with the computer. In order to have sound you need a 3mm jack which the PS4 does not have the USB seems to be a power source for the brilliant blue lights. I don’t recommend these at all. The lights are nice but NOT worth it since they don’t do what they should.,79,5.0,2022,08,August,09
Awful awful microphone,3,"I purchased this as an admittedly cheap headset just have something to use until I could afford a better one, and within 2 weeks of owning it the headset stopped working - would not be detected at all by any of my PCs. I had Amazon replace it with another one and that 2nd one failed the exact same way less than 48 hours later. Unreal! I would advise anyone looking for a headset to look elsewhere. Terrible, cheap, awful product!",81,1.0,2022,08,August,09
Good,1,My son loves these for using with his tablet or plugging into the Nintendo Switch.,15,5.0,2022,08,August,08
Works... most of the time,5,The cord is very long for use with a Xbox controller.  If the usb isn’t used it’s just in the way.  Is not plug and play on PC.,28,2.0,2022,08,August,08
Horrible headset. Stopped working after a little more than a month,11,I can still hear my PS4 I thought the noise cancelation would have been better and the mic quality is a little muffled but everything else is great,28,1.0,2022,08,August,08
"Poor mic quality, otherwise good unit",6,I got these for my boyfriend’s birthday & he loves them. They for sure noise cancel because I have to scream at him for him to hear me. You would have to connect the light usb to a power source if you’re not gaming on a computer but works great for his daily use.,54,3.0,2022,08,August,08
It’s the worst headset I’ve ever seen,7,My grandson was so excited to use them with his Playstation 4,12,1.0,2022,08,August,07
Great,1,Ordered this for my 12-year-old son. The second he opened it he could tell it was junk but he tried to give it a fair shot. Both my boys are really big into gaming and they said that this is pier crap. The microphone doesn’t work at all he can’t talk to any of his friends. I’d return it but my time is more valuable than this item. If your kid is little and he doesn’t have any friends to talk to this might last a week or two. But besides that he was pretty upset. I wouldn’t buy it if I were you I had to order him a different set so just my opinion. If you don’t know what you’re looking for don’t get this ( mom doesn’t know),131,5.0,2022,08,August,07
bad,1,"These headphones are comfortable and the noise cancelling is great. The sound quality is also very good both through the headphones and through the mic, the only issue is the wires. It's impossible to use the lights through the USB and plug in the headphone jack at the same time on my laptop because the USB and headphones inserts are on opposite sides and the wire isn't long enough, which is really irritating when the actual wire is very long and its just the split wires part that's too short. The extender they give with the product also seems cheap. The sound through the headphones with the extender is completely messed up to the point of it being unusable. None of these problems are with the headphones itself, so I still gave 5 stars, but it's annoying that I can't use every feature included. Honestly the product is a solid 4.5 stars.",152,1.0,2022,08,August,07

Worked for my nintendo switch but not for my Xbox,10,"I have trouble getting it to keep up good audio. Sometimes it's ok, but it's been going downhill steadily for a year.Mic has only one axis of rotation, so I can't get it closer to my mouth. That's part of the issue, but only part.It's also not very comfy, as the spring force is too strong and the earmuffs too firm.Overall they are cheap and they feel like it and sound like it. I would get something better were I you.",81,2.0,2022,08,August,06

Amazing buy,2,I recently just bought this headset for my Xbox when I went to test it out. The wire was way to long for gaming and when I tried using it all I can hear are cracks every time I talk. Don’t buy this ever go for a different pair.,49,5.0,2022,08,August,06

Great,1,"I've had these for a little over four years now and I have had no problems with them at all.  Mic is great, sound is great, volume control is easy.  There are blue lights in the headset that light up if you plug the USB portion in for power.  They are everything I need/want in a headset.Edit:I've used these exclusively with playstation/Xbox consoles over the past 4 years with no problems, but recently I've started using them for PC gaming as well and for some reason the mic does not work with PC. Sound coming through the headphones is still fine though.",102,5.0,2022,07,July,28

LED LIGHTS WONT WORK WITH XBOX,6,"I got my headset a few days after I ordered it and it turned out that one side is not working so I notified them and right then and there they replaced it with a Red one(as I requested because it just goes along with my computer, no questions asked. the headset looks AWESOME! I love the lights.Anyway, besides the awesome lights, this has got to be one of the most decent(sound-wise/quality) and most awesome-looking headsets out there, and for a very sweet price. I mean a price like that for a headset like this is very cheap. I repeat...the price is very cheap for what this headphone's worth.If you're a gamer and do not want to spend a crap ton of money for a decent headset, you might want to try this.",133,3.0,2022,07,July,23
Waste of money,3," No stuffing in the box to keep the product for bouncing around in the box. Which came with dents all in it. Which can cause the product to become damaged in transit. It seems like an issue they could easily address.It advertised sound quality that it could not deliver on. The sound quality is terribly poor. It sounded like I was listening to the TV instead of a headset. Even though the sound was coming from the headset. This is with the volume on the headset turned all the way up.It was advertised as a headset that can be used with gaming consoles. You need a USB for the lights, but the chord for that is splits from the aux input and the chord is only ≈8 inches after the split. Meaning if you're using a controller your not able to enjoy the full experience of the headset, because you would need to be have the controller ≈8 inches from the USB source. Not to mention, the lights aren't as bright as advertised in the pictures.It advertising noise isolating mic. Personal testing found this to be false. Not only could I hear the video I was listening to on YouTube, but I could hear my air conditioning in the background. Not what I would call noise isolation.Some people said the headset was too small. I found it to be too big in my experience. Either that, or they are just too loose because of the padding quality on the ears. I can shake my head slightly and it'll fall right off. When I game I like to immerse myself in the game. Which might mean small quick movements and leaning side to side. That would cause the headset to fall off your head. Watch video for demonstration.Speaking of the padding on the ears, that might be what causes this headset to not be noise cancelling. My JBL ear buds have more noise cancelling capabilities than this headset does. I could still hear when someone opened the front door to my building while playing my game.I will be returning these and requesting a refund.",353,1.0,2022,07,July,28
It broke with in two weeks,6,Hubby says these are more comfy to wear than the $100 ones I bought him last Christmas. He plays COD and said that they cancel out the noise of the household going on around him and he's able to wear them for several hours without them hurting his ears or head at all.,53,1.0,2022,07,July,28

OUTSTANDING,1,"I can't attest to how noise-canceling they are or the sound quality. My kids took them out of the box & hated how short the mic was. So I returned them. Otherwise, I think they would've worked just fine. But we had headphones like these at one point in time (supposedly) & bc the mic is too short (it doesn't come fully at the mouth) - others you're gaming with have a hard time hearing you. This is a review from a kid gamer who SHOUTS at everyone so I'm sure that if they can't hear you bc the mic is too far away then that's gospel truth in gaming land.",111,5.0,2022,07,July,27

I have a big head and when I pull it open to put on (stretch just a little) I feel like the plastic is about to break.  Also the hard plasic isn't a great fit and feels kind of odd.  I probably should have returned them, but needed them for work so I kept them. People can hear me and I can deal with it since I am not on calls all day.",95,5.0,2022,07,July,27

Good for its price,4,"This is a decent headset if you're using it for PC gaming. There is no noise cancelation. The loudest volume is not that loud to be honest. The LED lights needs the USB to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller. You can use it for Playstation or Xbox but you can't use LED unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with a USB port. I guess I should have expected this since it wasn't too expensive although for this product I think the price is a lot. This is equivalent to a 15 dollar headset based on sound quality, no noise cancelation and the LED lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you're playing on Playstation.",134,3.0,2022,07,July,21
Great headset,2,"I've had many headsets over the years and this one's sound quality is right up there with the best of the mid-priced headsets; however, the quality of the outgoing sound from the microphone is horrible.

Absolute garbage,2," (Bought for gentle PC gamer girl)This headset is a pretty good one I would say. The microphone kind of sounds like you’re talking on a toaster so I would recommend getting a separate mic setup if you’re planning to use these for streaming or making videos. The volume control is located on the cord, the only complaint I have is that it occasionally gets stuck in the arm of my chair and lowers itself. The lights are not colored it looks to just be regular LED lights in a plastic casing so if you’re buying these for someone who rages at games they could very easily break them.",108,1.0,2022,07,July,17

The Best way to Gaming,5,"Ok, so I am not a super tech person and I am not sure if this is a fixable problem or not, but only one side of the headphones work. That was the whole reason on buying another pair of headphones, because my first pair of a different brand started to break and lose hearing in one side. I just opened mine and yet it has the same problem. Other than that, they seem great! Just wished mine worked, y’a know?",81,5.0,2022,07,July,15
very happy with this set,5,"Absolutely zero complaints.  I prefer wireless, but if I wanted I would have purchased wireless. Comfortable, great sound and it does have an extremely long cord that makes it nice.",30,4.0,2022,07,July,15

Great value gaming headset,4,These are not bad at all for the price. Whenever I’m playing a game online they work and sound great. I’ve only had them about a month now but no issues whatsoever.,32,5.0,2022,07,July,15
Junk,1,Good,1,1.0,2022,07,July,15
Would recommend!,2,Constant clicking sounds and static over the microphone. This product is just terrible and is most likely due to the cheap 3.5mm design with no QC over it. The sound quality is decent but the cheap plugs they use make it a failure since you will end up with the annoying buzzing sound. Maybe you can get lucky and get a headphone with the plugs properly fitted but chances are even a little bump here or there will easily knock it off place. Good luck taking your chances with this product.,91,5.0,2022,07,July,15
Mic is very bad but has good sound quality,9,no sound and hard to talk,6,1.0,2022,07,July,14
DOSN'T WORK!!!!,2,"Perfectly acceptable for both business meetings and Discord chats, but the sound quality isn't too good. You sound like you're coming from far away. Other than that, it's worked for years. No other complaints.",34,1.0,2022,07,July,14
"Super bulky, and mic issues after 6 months",8,"Product says it works on Xbox one, it does not, headset has a USB plug when Xbox does not support USB headsets",22,2.0,2022,07,July,14
Mic hardly works,3,The Best,2,1.0,2022,07,July,13
Doesn’t work with Xbox controller,5,Love the over all sixe and make of the unit .. the mic has no problem and one you set the volume to hear others on the phone or computer you are good to go.. TH long chord is a bit much for close phone use so the velcro tab was hepful till I set a tie rap as I workout or in my wheel chair dose not need trip hazards.,71,1.0,2022,07,July,13
Waste of money.,3,The microphone is too short so if you have a big head the people ur talking to won’t be able to hear you.,23,1.0,2022,07,July,12
"Works for about a month fine, then mic goes out",10,"Poor sound quality , like if someone stuffed a papper  towel or cotton ball in it .",17,3.0,2022,07,July,12
My grandson liked the head phones,6,"They were decently sounding with a good amount of noise cancellation. However, these were more intended for pc because there is two cords, one for sound and one for the lights. The cord is too short to connect it to the ps4. Also the cord is big and gets in the way too much while gaming.",56,5.0,2022,07,July,11
Gift for Grandson,3,"Solid gaming headset for a very good price, over the ear provides good noise cancellation, the plastic materials used in the headset feel a little cheap but I’ve had my headset for the last few years and it still works well",41,4.0,2022,07,July,11
Great Headset for a great price!,6,Bought these for my sons birthday in May and gave them to him first week in June. It’s The second week in July and the sound and microphone cut in and out. This product is junk and not worth the money.,41,5.0,2022,07,July,11
Didn't last long before they crapped the bed,8,"My 8yr old daughter is new to gaming and loves to game with my 12 & 13yr old nephews. I got them each this head set and so far they love it!

Great gear,2,"This headset is so big and bulky, especially for a kid. The audio is fine, and is better than most budget headsets. The mic started having static issues after 6 months. Every time you slightly move the cable, the static is incredibly loud through the mic to the people you're playing with. That tells me the internal components are poor quality or poorly put together.",65,5.0,2022,07,July,10
Great customer service,3,When I got this immediately I ran into problems with the mic. My friends couldn't hear me and I could barely hear them. It never picked up my voice no matter how loudly I spoke. They would hear every other word but never the complete sentence. I tried to work with it for weeks but ended up using my Webcam mic for a while because it sounded better and I could be heard.,73,5.0,2022,07,July,10
Comes with splitter,3,"The second we plug the mic into the Xbox controller, the controller turns off. When we take it out, the controller turns back on. Tried it with all 5 of our controllers. Bogus. Do not buy.",36,4.0,2022,07,July,10

Not so great.,3,Gift,1,2.0,2022,07,July,09
Great Value headed,3,"Really nice headset. The only note I've got is if you are using this for a PS4, the USB placement to power up the lights on the headset is right next to the audio jack (like connected 8-10"" away).  Not very practical and you'd have to put a USB extension on it if you want to power up the lights.  I could care less about the lights, so I've got high marks for this.  Great noise cancellation, sound is crisp, and headset is very comfortable.",85,4.0,2022,07,July,09
that is a good product,5,"Worked well at first.  Few months later, all incoming sounds came in sounding like the speakers were blown.  They just keep getting worse.  It's so difficult understanding people.",28,5.0,2022,07,July,09

Just The Best 👌,4,"The ear cups fit really good. Have not had a chance to use for skype or other mic features so can't say on that. It DOES come with mic/speaker split connector, which it does say you need to order. LED's are bright!",42,5.0,2022,07,July,08

Works well for Xbox series X,6,"I use this when I'm gaming on my pc, and as my work headset when in traveling.

Quality was terrible,3,"The noise canceling is false. At first when I used them they were good I owned 2 pairs of these, and the same problem happened with both. After a while the sound only goes to one side you have to mess with the volume adjustment to get both sides to work. If you move it even a little it only works on one side again. Will not be buying again",70,1.0,2022,07,July,02
Great headset for the money,5,Works well for Xbox X. Good quality sound. Style is nice. Fits perfect for large heads.,16,5.0,2022,07,July,02

everything is great except for one thing,7,These headphones so far are great no complaints purchased for 11 year old gamer in May so still fairly new,20,5.0,2022,06,June,27

Great headphones,2,Works great and looks cool! Great value for the money.,10,5.0,2022,06,June,24
Mediocre Product,2,"Everything works great except one thing. Microphone cannot eliminate the noise from my surrounding.

bad,1,Everything was fine with this set. I was in a pinch and needed a new one. Noise cancelation is good - can't ever hear what my sister or boyfriend are saying to me haha. But I don't use the lights or anything. Just for mic and hearing,47,1.0,2022,06,June,24
Worst company,2,"Title says all. Good for the price, but the USB is literally for lights only. And the mic mute button doesn't work.As a basic generic headset though, A+.",28,1.0,2022,06,June,23

So far so good,4,"A little after a month, the connection where the wire meets the plug for the controller went bad, now the headset is useless. Do yourself a favor and get either wireless or a better made headset.",36,5.0,2022,06,June,21
It's ok for the price,5,I like the head phones. The sound is good.,9,3.0,2022,06,June,21
Great headset,2,"The Good: Decent sound quality, and relatively comfortable.The Bad: Uses an analogue jack for the speakers, making plugging it into certain devices difficult or impossible without an add-on like a splitter. The microphone is an inflexible piece of plastic and people I talk to online complain about my voice being muffled and distorted.Overall: Overpriced for what amounts to an okay pair of headphones.",63,4.0,2022,06,June,21
Don’t expect to use the lights,6,At the start I noticed that they weren't that loud even with the volume on 50-60. I ignored it though because it wasn't that bad. I regret doing that because now they got even lower with the sound on 100!  This product isn't worth buying....,45,3.0,2022,06,June,20

Great!,1,"I like stuff loud, I’m a bit of an audiophile, but I don’t like spending a lot unless it’s worth it. I prefer cheap and effective, and that is this.I used to use the official PlayStation wireless headphones that cost over $100. And those were great, but then they stopped charging, and I got these.I freed up the USB port that was being used by the wireless headphones because these headphones plug into the wireless controller.So for a lot less money, it’s still wireless!And they sound great.",87,5.0,2022,06,June,19

Crap,1,"I had been looking for a gaming headset for my PS4. I'm a casual gamer and I was looking for something that I could use when I play late at night.

When I tried them on, they felt comfortable and I have been using them for long period of time and my ears have not gotten tired.The sound quality is surprisingly good, with good bass, and I can hear the surround sound effects of my games. The voice chat quality is very good with clear quality. In terms of noise cancellation, it's not true noise cancellation. I can still hear sounds form outside when playing but it's minimal.Overall, I'm pleased with these headphones as they do their job just fine.",150,1.0,2022,06,June,18

They also tried to talk me into deleting the below review, but it was my honest experience with the headset that I received.*Original Review*This worked well for a very short while, but now the microphone is way too quiet and nobody can hear me (in Discord). The sound quality through the headphones is still good, but I can't use it to game with other people because they can't hear me. It's such a shame. It also doesn't have an option to use the laptop's microphone instead of the headset, so I can't just use it for the headphones.",142,5.0,2022,06,June,11

Amazing!,1,"Honestly I’m very surprised by the sound quality. The noise cancelling I would say is 9/10, sometimes I’m afraid i can’t hear if someone calls me at home.

Descent budget headset,3,The wires are flimsy around the audio jack and mic jack. To the point that you have to adjust them a specific way to get sound to come out of both sides of the headset. Accidently move the wire and you have to try to readjust it.,47,4.0,2022,05,May,24

My son hasn't broken them yet so that's a win.,10,The USB plug for the PC is totally useless as the PC will constantly complain about an unknown device plugged into the port. Contacted support. What a joke. Told me to return the product for another one. NO THANK YOU!!!! This goes in the garbage where it belongs. No quality control.They sent me an email. Wanted to send me a replacement! NO! Already threw it away as it stopped working.You can't buy my good review with cash or another of your defective products!DO NOT BUY!!!I wish I had read the customer reviews.JUNK!!!,92,5.0,2022,05,May,20
Cheap and doesn’t work.,4,"This product was a little disappointing to be honest. For one, I wish I had paid attention to the fact that this is not wireless. Second, the lights don't come on with mic jack. Which sure it wouldn't make sense to but it really should have just been a USB with an adaptor. Otherwise if you don't care about lights, it works fine. I'd say it's better suited for PC gaming since usually there's a mic jack next to a USB port. But not for consoles. Its not the worst. Just the sound quality is kind of minimal. It doesn't play music too well. It can get loud but then the sound gets shrill amd will induce headach. Truthfully, I wouldn't buy this again.",124,1.0,2022,05,May,18
Not what i need,4,Not happy with this headset. Other gamers complained about the background sounds and made a remark about buying a cheap headset.,21,5.0,2022,05,May,18

Static and dosnt work great at all!,7,I recently ordered these headphones after having a Logitech headset go out on me after a few weeks of owning them. For the price they are really good.,28,1.0,2022,05,May,18
It's too big for my head,6,"Keep in mind this is my first Bengoo headset so I assume it's a rare case. However, this was not a great first impression. I was using it on my PC, but It probably works best as a console headset.The headset itself looks great, the speaker sounds nice, and I love the design for not only the aesthetic but the mic buttons on the cable as well. Unfortunately, that's all positive comments I can give.-The setup app did not connect to the headset, no matter if I enabled it on windows defender or restarted the computer for it to reset. Not only that, it takes 2-3 attempts to open the app. I needed to end the background task of the first attempt to open it. Then it didn't even recognize the headset at all, no options to configure or anything.-Trying to use another app for the setup was annoying and had me constantly checking the ports. When I finally got connected to the mic, I was greeted with the sound of rain-like static that was louder than my own voice volume.-The volume of the mic itself was so low, I needed to increase it to the maximum value. It also has a default super bass feel to it that makes your voice more muffled than recognizable. I was hoping to replace my PC gaming headset but I can't say I feel confident buying this one.",235,4.0,2022,05,May,17
Love this headset!,3,it works good for a year but after the mic went out I had to order A new adapter and a month later the mic stoped working agan the adapter was 5$,32,5.0,2022,05,May,17
Decent price decent quality!,4,"This is by far the WOSRT head set I’ve yet to get. Only two weeks in and I absolutely despised it.1. The mic is way to far away from your mouth. Even with sensitivity all the way up, my friends could barely hear me.2. It’s a fixed mic. All it can do is go up and down.3. Far to stiff. Feels like a vice around my head.4. Mic quality is garbage. Sounds canny and fuzzy.Honestly you can buy better headsets for the same price. Not as good but better than this dumpster fire of a headset. At least it’ll make decent target practice",103,5.0,2022,05,May,17

TOP NOTCH 👌🏽,3,"I am an adult with a smaller head and sometimes I feel like these headphones are slipping off when I'm gaming. But that is really the only complaint I have. I tend to just use one of my beanies to keep it from slipping. I don't like the ""cutesy"" headphones they make for smaller heads that's why I chose this one. Otherwise, I like these headphones alot.",67,5.0,2022,05,May,15
These aren't bad,3,"My 3 boys love to game on their computer, Xbox and Nintendo switch. This headset is great for all gaming experience. Great sound and microphone. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the cord can get tangled easily and when that happens it doesn’t give the 5 star experience. I have bought several of these though and will continue to get the same as they get worn out! The price for the quality of the product is 100% worth it!",84,4.0,2022,05,May,15
Has cut my sons finger twice,6,I have 1 year and 6 month with mine and havent run in any issues so far.,17,4.0,2022,05,May,15
Great Customer Service,3,My husband enjoys movies however his taste and my taste aren't the same.  Since getting these headphones we can be in the same room with him enjoying a movie on his laptop while I'm watching a movie on tv.  My husband says the sound quality of these headphones is good.  As far as noise cancelling...he says that some background noise does creep in but not enough to interfere with whatever movie he's watching.  I'm pleased with these headphones and will probably buy another pair for my grandson.,87,5.0,2022,05,May,15
What you'd expect for the price.,6,"Don't waste your money on this junk. DOES NOT WORK. Had it a few days, DOESN""T WORK. First the left ear went out, then the right completely. Total pile of junk.",31,4.0,2022,05,May,13

Worked for a few days!,5,"They were a decent headset for the price. But they weren't for me.Pros -Long cordGlasses friendlySemi sound proofThe mic was pretty decent sounded like I was in a tunnel sometimes thoEasy to adjustCons -Did not fit well over my ears, they were kind smallThe texture was also icky. To me it felt like skate board wheels again my ears, just squishyThey don't light up unless they are plugged into the PC. But that really didn't matter for meOther that that, they were pretty ok. Just not for me. Hence why I return mine, and try something else. So if I you wanna give them a try still, they may be great for you! If not the return was as easy as heck.",122,2.0,2022,05,May,12

2 month lifespan. Garbage.,4,"I bought this because it is a gaming headphone and the reviews looked to be a good quality. However, I plugged it into my PC and at first only the audio output was working and recognized on my computer. When I unplugged it to see if that would fix the microphone not being recognized, the sound stopped working. I ran a troubleshoot program and the PC doesn't even acknowledge the headphones being plugged in with the jack. Looked online, its a very common problem.",84,1.0,2022,05,May,09
Don’t buy this item,4,"I seen in the description that it said it would work for xbox one. I went no further. After receiving the head phones, we noticed it did not work for xbox one. So i opened the instructions and there we seen that an adapter is needed for xbox one. And it is $40. Dont buy these for xbox, as between this and the adapter you will spend almost $100….",69,1.0,2022,05,May,09

Great headphones at a great price,6,"Not horrible, it's just a good, basic gaming headset. My old wired turtle beach headset still sounds better than this thing.

Sound quality is muffled. Microphone is very weak and must be turned up.,13,This product is nice and easy to use but the sound quality isnt the best id much rather go with some turtle beach headphones or just earbuds all together.,29,1.0,2022,05,May,05
Well worth it,3,Has a cool look and very comfortable but after just a few days it stopped working. It sucks because i ordered this a head of time for my son for Easter and unfortunately the return window has closed so I'm out $23 and my son has no headset.,48,5.0,2022,05,May,05
Great item,2,"I liked that the colors really popped so I almost never lost it, but ultimately, it's just a pair of headphones with a really static-ey mic.",26,5.0,2022,05,May,04

THANK YOU,2,"I don’t really like leaving bad reviews but these headphones were not what I was hoping for. I got these for my boyfriend and now I feel like crap cuz I feel like I got him cheap headphones for Christmas. They look cool and the sound quality is fine, not the greatest but it does the job for the most part. The microphone is not the greatest and all his friends say they can barely hear him on the other end no matter what he does and we have messed with this since December and it’s not gotten better. The mic picks up a lot of background staticky sounds and if you want the lights to be on they have to either be plugged into a portable battery or plugged in plugged in or plugged into your gaming conceal or computer. I’m just a little disappointed because the reviews seemed great on this but oh well. They are cool but not the best for gaming",165,5.0,2022,05,May,03

"Comfort & Speed both of them,  With one low pric",10,First of all none of the cords work plugging it both into the PlayStation controller.

Worst Headset I bought in last 3 years,8,Sound Quality was so bad I just bought a Razer.  You get 2 stars automatically if I have to use TWO in between wires.  Engineering genius.  Lets add 3 more Jacks/USB which is the weakest link of every headphone in existence.  Honestly you might as well pay 5x for wireless then all this Chinese Crap that is gonna break in a few months of wear and tear.,67,1.0,2022,05,May,02
Waste of money,3,It's a bit bulky but I find I hear clearly. I like that it has a volume button. I have it for 2 months now and it hasn't broken yet although it does feel a bit wobbly like it could break if you're not caref with it. The microphone could be longer so others can hear you more clearly,59,1.0,2022,05,May,01
Works really well,3,"I've tried and tried to set up the microphone to work. I can hear everyone talking, but no one can hear my voice. (I'm using a laptop, and non of the laptop today has two plug-ins for the microphone and speaker(One is pink and one in green)). The microphone is ON, but the PC system doesn't know about the device.

But on the new ones, unless I turn the column down really, really low the sound distorts.I thought I would like these as much as the last ones so I destroyed the box, I wish I hadn't or I would send this back in a heartbeat.

Should've left previous review up,5,"The good? The Price and they work.The bad.Very short coord, more suited for a laptop user than a desktop.Requires both usb and 3.5mm ports to be used for either to work, disconnect one and headset stops.Very poor sound.  Its too quiet, forget noise cancellation, you can hear your phone ring on medium with these on full sound on youtube.For some reason, the left ear is hotter than the right side, assuming because mic is on the left side?I have bought headphones half this price from Sades, that had much better sound and coord length, but sadly they didnt have red and black anymore.  Should of went with blue and black.  This headset was twice as expensive and nothing to be happy about.I will not buy another from this company",129,1.0,2022,04,April,22

"Great headset, one complaint",4,"For the price I paid for this headset it’s amazing. It’s actually the closest to the more expensive high quality headset that I have found so far. It’s pretty good at blocking out background noise, the sound effects and voices are clear to hear and can go pretty loud if you choose to turn the volume up. It sits quite comfortably on my head, I have a smaller head as I’m a female and I also wear glasses when I’m gaming so I was thoroughly surprised to find there wasn’t too much pressure on my glasses or my ears. I would highly recommend this headset. 10/10.",106,4.0,2022,04,April,19

God awful…,2,"I like that it sounds/noise cancellation really good . What i don't like is that it's heavy and too small/tight for my big 20 year old's head(58.5cm or 23 inches in circumferences). Gaming for long time like ~2 hours make you really dizzy aftereffect are bad headaches, nausea, and disorientation due to uncomfortable. So i don't really recommends this for adults or kids with big head.I would like if this headphone extends a bit more maybe like 1 inch. it would make the grip less, so it won't be uncomfortable.",90,1.0,2022,04,April,19

Great,1,Bought these for my son as a birthday gift And was so disappointed when he realized they did not work at all. The first bad review I left was deleted when the company promised a $25 gift card if we would delete it. We deleted the review and never received the gift card so here is the second bad review.

I turned them all the way up just to actually hear footsteps in my game. 3 the lights don’t work unless your in pc ( I don’t care too much about that) 4. The mic sounds terrible. My friends clowned me for having such a god awful mic. This would be the last gaming headset I would buy. Don’t waste your money on this…,79,5.0,2022,04,April,11

After hearing the sound from these I am probably going to order me a new pair cause mine apparently are horrible but I won't these cause they just don't fit me well.

Works well,2,"I had read other reviews and was excited to order and recieve my Bengoo. Recently my neighbors have been having parties and playing music loud enough you could feel it shake the walls, so I was very eager to see the noise cancellation come into action as I could relax while I immerse myself in my game. Sadly it made no difference compared to my old headphones. I could still identify whatever song they play through the Bengoo while playing games. If you have an average pair of noise-cancellation headphones, you may want to seek a premium brand of headphone. Though, if you are seeking a cheap option, this is not a bad option for first-timers/budget",116,5.0,2022,04,April,06

good headset for a decent price,6,"Cheap plastic feel. Right out the box the audio would cut out just from moving the wire (even the most basic movement caused it to short out).

Gave 2 stars because atleast the light worked and the headset looks nice, other then that it's junk.Update, was contacted by company and sent a new headset which works perfect so gave 5 star review now because headset has good sound quality, it's light weight and comfortable to wear for hours at a time. Also added bonus is that the cord is a decent length so it doesn't limit you on movement.",108,4.0,2022,03,March,26

Walmart 10$ headset was better then this crap.

6 months old and dead,5,"I am just a low key kinda gamer. I don't have a lot of money, or a fancy set up- just a fan for my gaming laptop and these! they match which is really cool. (see photo)I have no complaints- I asked a guy on roblox VC how I sounded on a scale from 1-10 and he said a 9.if you are like me or have kids who also play games similar to me (such as roblox or elite dangerous or just have general steam/discord needs) then I would recommend this headset. Although its plastic it doesn't feel low quality or cheap. I feels well made and sturdy, I've dropped this think like 10 times already and also stepped on and by mistake yanked on the cord- it's still working great though. also the volume control and mic on and off buttons all work fine.if you don't game for a living, but want something that finally isnt junk, but aren't rich- this in my opinion is your solution.",168,1.0,2022,03,March,23

I would recommend it.Previous review:The only issue I have with it is the sound quality. I have to turn up the volume all the way to be able to get decent sound. Noise cancellation is good. I might get them replaced for something else.",92,5.0,2022,03,March,22
Speaker didnt ladt a month,5,"Bought these after my kids broke my sony gold headset. While these do not have as great features at the gold headsets as don’t offer as well sound quality and noise cancellation while also being wireless, I expected a step down in quality as I was purchasing something to bare the damage they might face until my kids (and cats) could Learn to mind others things. While they are a step down, I’m surprised at how much I like them. I like the volume control on the cord rather than the headset so I can see if It if I need to and while not as great, they do have some noise cancellation. There isn’t much base nor any surround sound features but for this price point I think that would be asking for too much. Overall I’m happy with them and until I feel the need to get a more expensive pair, these will be what I use. I will definitely hold onto them as backup pair if I ever do upgrade as well.",175,1.0,2022,03,March,22

I am extremely pleased with my new product.

Thx,1,"This is specifically for the Green and Black Bengoo G9000 professional gaming headset.The quality of this headset for the price is near unbeatable. Headset feels very durable/kid proof. It’s made of ABS plastic with metal inserts on the adjustable band. The ear cushions on these are pleather pillow cushions and they are extremely comfortable. I have an absolutely huge head, and these fit just right. The ear cups fit over my ears entirely and they do a decent job of blocking out ambient sound.The headset is very light weight, making it very comfortable to use for long play sessions. I had no ear or head pain from wearing these for extended periods of time.The integrated volume control and mute switch work very well. The cord is extra long (8ft) and it’s braided the entire way. This cord feels pretty premium and even has a Velcro cord wrap on it.It comes with a PC Splitter just in case you have a setup like that. The USB only powers the LED lights, and they are very green. Therefore, the USB does not have to be plugged in, but is a nice touch if you’re into that sort of thing. Personally I really like the lights and think they are nice, but I don’t use them every time either.Microphone quality is very good and the noise canceling system seems to work extremely well on it. Only time echo was noticed was when volume was at 100% and even then, it was not bad at all. I went through numerous $70-$100 headsets in the last three weeks trying to find a microphone that didn’t echo all my friends’ voices back at the slightest sound of speech. Seriously, it was pathetic how garbage the microphones are on the expensive Hyper X and Nacon Rig headsets.Sound quality is superb for the price point. These are pretty bass heavy if you like that sort of thing. Very reminiscent of Skullcandy sound quality. I like this type of sound myself, because in a shooter you literally feel the bass with this headset. Highs are also good if not a little less pronounced, and I had no problem hearing footsteps in shooters. In games like fortnite that’s exactly what you want.These also sound very well with directional 3D audio like Dolby Atmos. So I definitely recommend these for surround sound gaming as well.My one minor complaint is that the cord for the USB is not long enough and it did not come with an extender. That’s a small price to pay though considering everything else is so good about these headphones.I’m now own multiple Bengoo products. This is a brand I trust in. Not only are they a quality brand, but their customer service is absolutely excellent. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this brand for any of your audio needs.",471,4.0,2022,03,March,13

Sound,1,I bought this for my son’s birthday Feb 17th. Less then a month of using it they are broke. I can’t return. Waste of money. Save your money and put it towards better quality.,34,5.0,2022,03,March,08
Sound is horrible,3,It's a very cheap headset. If you're just looking for something that'll just get the job done this works. It's not bad or terrible just cheap. Although after wearing the headset for a while my ears started to hurt but that might've been a personal issue,46,1.0,2022,03,March,08

Cheap trash,2,There is No lighting up of the headset unless a very short cord is in the USB @ same time as the other that is plugged into the gaming unit. That’s falsely advertised. It sounds good and works good but NO LIGHTS AT ALL & that’s mainly why I picked this one. Bummer.,53,1.0,2022,03,March,07

High quality for low price!,5,"This is a piece of garbage. It's uncomfortable with small ear muffs that make it a pain to wear. The sound quality is subpar, and the mic is SO quiet. I'm unable to be heard at all. I even tested with my old mic, and the difference is night and day. Even checked my Windows settings and the mic was all the way up. I was absolutely baffled because all of the reviews here make this seem like a halfway decent product, but I can assure you, buying this is the single best way to waste money. This is a hunk of garbage.",103,5.0,2022,03,March,03

Did not completely work with switch,6,"I’ll be honest at such a low price I didn’t have big expectations. I was ready to try them and send them back if I didn’t like them.Positives: the sound quality is actually really good, and it does block out ambient noise. They are comfortable, I don’t think they are too heavy, some of the wireless headphones hurt after awhile, one reason I choose wired.Negatives: it had a volume control, and although nice to have it adds weight to the cord, so I have to make sure I put the volume control in my lap, or else it pulls on the headphones, and it’s heavy. The mic only moves up and down, which I wish it could move away or towards your mouth too.Overall, for the price, these are nice.",130,2.0,2022,03,March,02
Doesn't work with laptop,4,"The colors are dang cool.. It doesn't work with the Xbox One S series. Not w/ an adapter. I wrote the seller and they took this very seriously and addressed my issues ASAP! Thank you so much. Sadly,  it just was not compatible with my Xbox One.

Decent for the price,4,"Stopped working after 4 months. Sound constantly goes in and out but was solid for the 1st 4 months. Also, Very long 7-8 inch wire which is very unnecessary and gets in the way. $25 bucks for a reason",39,4.0,2022,02,February,27
Work great,2,Skip past every comment besides this one. Best headset ever 100/10 quality lmfao 😂😂😂 you see the taped cig box on the mic that's the only way people can hear you threw the headset I only figured this out cause I was joking around about the POS with my fiancee and cuffed my hand around my mouth and the mic and it worked well cig pack is almost the right size but still works have to funnel all noise to it noise cancelation golden even the gamers voice is cancelled out unless you do this,95,5.0,2022,02,February,27

My kis love it,4,"*UPDATE* After I left the below negative review the company contacted me and offered me $30 to remove it. I would assume that several reviewers have taken them up on this offer and have removed negative reviews. So not only is the product junk, but the company has shady business practices. Skip it, go somewhere else.This is the second pair I bought for my son. I guess I didn't learn my lesson the first time. First one worked for two months, this one worked for less than two weeks. It's $20ish for a reason. Don't waste your time.",98,5.0,2022,02,February,25
Great,1,USB plug is short and doesn't reach most ports.if you have the audio jack plugged as well.,17,5.0,2022,02,February,24

Not the best,3,"This is probably the single most frustrating headset I have ever dealt with.  The 3.5mm jack fits loosely in a Dell workstation, it is not wired correctly (does not work in a combo headset/mic jack on the same workstation).  The USB connection is purely to power the LEDs.I ended up replacing with a cheaper headset from a reputable manufacturer and all of the issues ceased.",65,1.0,2022,02,February,20
I like these headphones,4,These headphones are very high quality for a low price. Very sturdy and don't feel cheap. They hold onto your head very snug and don't slip like alot of other headsets. The sound quality is better than some high end headsets I've used and they cancel noise outside of the headset very well. The cord is also very long so you're not restricted on how much you can move with them on as it is a wired headset ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,79,5.0,2022,02,February,19
Quality service,2,"Headset randomly stopped working one day. I was in the middle of a game and all of my audio got cut. Nothing I could do to fix it. Cheap quality headset, do NOT buy.",34,5.0,2022,02,February,19

The headphones themselves feel very nice and strong but still comfortable they fit on my adult head and my ear sit comfortably even with my piercings in. The lights aren't too bright and overwhelming but just right. I was surprised by the sound quality, I can hang these on my neck and still hear my game or music.

I will definately do business with them again.,67,1.0,2022,02,February,12
worth buying,2,"I like the looks, feel and sounds of these headphones. The cable could be longer and a longer cable separation of the input USB and the ear jack would be an improvement.

It does not work AT ALL. DON'T BUY.,8,"Used these headphones while playing on the ps4. I did a stream to test out how I'd sound to other. It was basically at a whisper even when I was raising my voice. Same problem when I tested the mic using my phone. The sound output is also low. I raised my ps4 headphone volume and it wasn't any louder then the headphones I was using before, at a lower volume. The wheel didn't help in either of these situations.",80,1.0,2022,02,February,08

Good for price,3,They show in pics like they are lit.  Not with a Nintendo switch.  Has a separate port to plug in which required me to add a cord with adapter. Super annoying. Would not have purchased.,35,5.0,2022,02,February,08

Good headset for gaming on PC,6,Bought for my husband! As far as he has told me and I can tell he like them a lot!!

Noise canceling works pretty well if you ask me I have to either go up to him and tap him or yell super loud for him to hear me!!!,74,5.0,2022,02,February,06
Poorly made product,3,"The sound is crystal clear and the wire prevents easy entanglement but I’ve noticed something after a couple of weeks of use. The ear pieces aren’t comfortable for adults due to them being too small. And what’s even worse is that I wear glasses and it makes it even more uncomfortable for me and even making it difficult to focus during gaming. I have to constantly try to move them around just for it to be bearable in comfort. So warning, not recommended with glasses and/or adults.",87,1.0,2022,02,February,05

No lights as described,4,My son loves them,4,3.0,2022,02,February,05
Doesn't last,2,"UPDATE: Seller realized I left a 1-star review and is now spamming me with gift card bribes to remove it. If you are wondering how a product with so many bad reviews somehow has over a 4-star rating, it's because they bribe buyers with gift cards to delete bad reviews or change them to 4+ stars.Original review:I purchased a BENGOO G9000, but the headset came in a Butfulake GH-1 box (pics attached).No user manual included. My mousepad came with more troubleshooting instructions!For some reason a gaming headset needed both a USB plug and an audio jack (good ones only need USB).My Windows 10 PC didn't recognize the USB when plugged in (all other USB headsets in my household work fine with the same PC). The blue ear lights go on, but no audio or microphone available.Apparently you have to use the audio jack to make the sound work, but still no working microphone with a non-functioning USB plug.Someone clearly tried to pass off their broken leftovers as ""new"". No idea how this seller and product became an ""Amazon Choice"" with strong customer ratings. Very scammy experience. Serves me right for trying to go cheap on electronics. I already started the return process.",202,2.0,2022,02,February,04

Awesome set,2,Amazon had it in the wireless section and it’s not wireless. In fact there are plenty of long wires to annoy you.

They arrived quickly and the box was in great shape. When I first took them out of the packaging I thought I had ordered the wrong kind because of the audio jack and USB hook up portion but after a little bit of examination I realized the USB was for the lights. I tested them on my phone first and oh my gods, the audio is so crisp and clear. I play Call of Duty: Vanguard with these and can hear footsteps from across the map, however I still die due to my bad aim. lol They work great on computers as well, on max volume I can hear them in my hallway when they are in my bedroom.",163,4.0,2022,02,February,01

"Love these headphones, I got the purple ones this time!",10,"Day 1 - Used it on my gaming pc. Huge issues. This headset by default will default itself to the speakers/microphone on your pc/laptop under the default settings making it very hard to make games and discord to detect the headset, and ultimately cuck you're stream setting abilities. After 3 hours of fiddling with settings, I finally was able to make it work correctly.Day 2 - Doesn't work at all now. Microphone works but the headset now doesn't produce any sound. And yes I did make sure my volume was turned all the way up through the hardware and software sides.I understand that I chose a cheap product to fulfill my needs of a headset but don't out right sell a faulty and useless product.Waste of time and money.",129,5.0,2022,01,January,31
Works great,2,"Just arrived and my son was so excited. We plug it into the Sony ps4 controller (not off-brand) and nobody can hear him chat in Fortnight.

I'm buying another pair due to accidental damage to my current pair.,12,I just got these 30 mins ago and tried them.First off it doesn’t light up unless you plug both ends into a port which means console players won’t get the light up. Second it’s just all around horrible with its sound. Thee most quiet whisper like sound. I bought it on the grounds of the high rating and good reviews but it didn’t come close to standards. I don’t know if this is just defective or what but this ain’t it and I am quite disappointed in the money I just gave to a company that couldn’t even hold standard for gaming.,102,5.0,2022,01,January,30
Awesome,1,"Is came with one side of the headset not working then when speaking into the mic the other party couldn’t hear what was being said.

Comfy but not for me,5,"1st off, this product advertises as if there are lights on it....there aren't. Its just a sticker that doesn't have any LED function. Very misleading.2nd, the headset is very poorly made. The earpieces barely fit my 3 year old. They are far too small to fit an adults ears.3rd, the sound quality is subpar. Takes a lot of adjustment and you'd get better quality from an Xbox 360 default headset.Do NOT buy this.",73,2.0,2022,01,January,28
A True Tank,3,Got these today and I’m not sure if I should even use them specially after learning most it’s reviews are fake. I bought a new console along side these and I’m not going to risk losing a new controller if the adapter decides to break off inside it like some reviewers say. The first red flag for me was definitely the packaging. it was packed in a large box with bubble wrap and just felt unofficial. There was also wear on the ear pieces indicating prior use. And the worst part is you don’t even have to use them in game to tell the mic is defective as it won’t even reach the front of you’re face. The cord as well as volume slider are a bit obnoxious in size. And the product overall feels like a fragile plastic off brand.I did test them on my switch and the sound was surprisingly good. I noticed background static at first which a lot of people mentioned but it wasn’t terrible or even noticeable at times.I’ll probably stash these away for a backup pair and just buy a name brand pair for the same or even better price. And if you are also looking for a solid gaming headset then please help yourself and look away from these.,216,5.0,2022,01,January,27

"Good sound, bad microphone",4,"So I just got these today and was excited. However, upon setting them up, I noticed that the ""light up"" function is only usable when hooking up the attached usb to the port on my ps5. Stupidly enough, there isn't enough cable split to also connect the headphones to your controller in order to use the headphones for its sole purpose. It's either they light up on the damn counter and look cute OR you talk to friends while playing online but there is no both so can you say....COMPLETE DESIGN FLAW, FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, AND BOTTOM LINE....THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO CLOSE SHOP AND GO FLIP BURGERS!!!!!",106,3.0,2022,01,January,27
Was a gift,3,"This works well for my son’s Xbox Series. He likes it! I would have given 5 stars if the USB cord that is to inserted into the port on the Xbox was longer. Because that cord is so short, he’s not able to experience the blue LED while playing.",49,5.0,2022,01,January,27

Works just fine.,3,Unfortunately our product broke but BENGOO reached out to us and was willing to issue us a full refund for our troubles.,22,5.0,2022,01,January,26
Very uncomfortable,2,You get what you pay for. Weak mic requires manual adjusting through computer. Sensitivity is low so you may have to raise it or scream into the mic.,28,1.0,2022,01,January,26
Awesome Headset,2,"I recently tried to go back to an old pair of headphones, and found them to be lacking. So I opted to buy a second pair of these since I had used them before and enjoyed them. After a side by side comparison, these headphones are more comfortable, have a much higher audio quality, and overall feel like they have a better build quality than other headphones I've used. If you're looking for a great product that looks good, and for a lower price than high end ones, buy these! You certainly won't regret it!",95,5.0,2022,01,January,26
"Good customer service, not great product",6,"I love this and it works great! You can adjust the sound and mute your mic very easily! The only down side is that you need a usb port to make it light up. It really does not matter if it lighted up or not, but i play on ps4 and only have a remote. I don’t have a pc to plug the usb into to make it light up. but overall i love it!",75,3.0,2022,01,January,26
Cords aren’t long enough to play on ps5 comfortably and it didn’t work for my ps4,16,"Had a few issues but customer service was awesome!! Problem was resolved immediately. Overall, I would buy headset again.",19,1.0,2022,01,January,26
Quality product,2,The cord is stupid. It's like its backwards. Only way to use the lights is plug the cord in and the cord for the lighst is literally a foot long. That means you are a foot in front of the tv when you play a game. Ridiculous,47,5.0,2022,01,January,26
Do not buy,3,This pair of headphones has worked really well for me. I plan on buying another pair because my current pair has gotten damaged due to my putting the pair on uneven surfaces and the wires have been tugged on too much. I knocked the head phones down on accident several times. I walked while wearing these head phones and I dropped my phone. The cord itself got accidentally tugged and unplugged from my phone. I won't be using these headphones outside my room anymore. Also my room is well enough organized now that I shouldn't end up knocking them over on accident anymore.,103,1.0,2022,01,January,25

Amazing,1,"This headset came with the microphone not even working! It wouldn't show up on my computer!! It's either the headset is broke, or the cord is! And on top of that, You can hear what's going on in the headset even if you're not the one wearing it! Very disappointed.",50,5.0,2022,01,January,24
10/10 would recommend,3,"Used these for gaming on my PC. Everyone I was playing with told me there was consistent background static every time I cued my mic. I tried several different ways to correct the static from setting up the headset on the PC and updating drivers and the issue persisted. The overall features of the headset were good, but the static issue won't work for me. I returned these and will be purchasing a different brand.",75,5.0,2022,01,January,24

Works good but I got 2 and both LED lights doesn’t work.,12,I bought these for my 6 year old daughter. She has a place to put them away safely and is great with taking care of her stuff. Today she went to plug these into her tablet (4th use) and the headphone plug pulled out of the cord. Very disappointed in the quality,52,1.0,2022,01,January,21
I don’t even know what’s happening,6,The cord is the same length of my height but overall it’s a great headset. On the cord is a Velcro strip and you can tie your cord up so it’s not as long but overall great headset,38,3.0,2022,01,January,21
Good value for the money,5,My last headset lasted me 3 years and finally died on me. I orded this one thinking it looked good. First off the mic isnt curvable to so i cant put it closer to my face and its to far. So now its half way on my ear so i can move it closer to my mouth. My friends can still barely hear me when im not speaking loudly and this is a problem since i have a 1 year old that sleeps near me. Ive also listened to myself and i sound like im inside of a can. The only postive i could find is that its really comfy and the sound quality is ok. Ill be sending this back tomorrow and ordering another rig headset since they clearly understand whats needed to make a good gaming headset.,139,5.0,2022,01,January,21
Dose not work,3,"Imagine you are in a game of League of Legends, you are 19-0-0 in the first 7 minutes. You are carrying everyone. You run top, Nasus scores a kill. You are now 19-1-0. The team is up in kills, you have just got the first tower. Rift is up, it's yours. Easy win.Now imagine the same game. Vayne goes AFK mid team fight, you get aced. Vayne returns and tells everyone that they are trash and throws up a forfeit vote. 1-4. No big deal.The time is now 16 minutes and it's time for a dragon fight. You are there, the enemy jungle is warded, river is warded, and you have contributed your 75 gold Control Ward to the occasion. It's time for the second team fight.

Great,1,"My son like this for playing online games on his Xbox had a previous turtle headset that he loved but that had gotten damage after long use. This item was confusing to use there’s a separate USB cord plug adapter that can be plugged in if you’re using it on a laptop or computer that will also make the unit light up but the lights only work if the USB cord is plugged in. During play sound often times would not work and microphone would intermittently cut in and out. *** update , now works better after resetting and updating controller for xbox***Volume and on off switchIs bulky and uncomfortable returning product going to buy another turtle",117,5.0,2022,01,January,21
Great!!,1,"Friend who this was bought for said the headphones had good sound quality from his games he was playing, but the microphone is muffled and you can barely make out what he's saying through voice chat.  Probably ok if you don't care about being heard.  The design looks nice enough.",50,5.0,2022,01,January,21
The light is a separate wire and isn't that long.,10,Purchased for Grandson- is a hit.  best part cord is not plastic its braded and cat won't eat the cord.  He is a beginner gamer.,25,2.0,2022,01,January,21
The sound is not loud enough.,6,I bought it for my boyfriend and his exact words where “the quality is juicy”😂. Meaning it’s was the best choice for him to do his gaming,27,1.0,2022,01,January,21
Pointless without adaptor that costs more than headphones,8,My son is happy with this headset.  Setup easily and sound great.,12,1.0,2022,01,January,21
The mic don’t work,4,"The sound quality on these is absolutely terrible for gaming. I tried them with music as well, also terrible. The volume wheel is upside down/backwards. The mic is worthless and not working properly. The LED lights are worthless for gaming on anything other than a PC. It is one cord with a very small split at the end, one to go into the controller and the other is a USB for the lights to work, but you can't use the lights and play on the PS4 or Xbox at the same time which makes these pretty pointless in that aspect. There is NO noise cancelation, whatsoever! 10 out of 10 would NOT recommend. These look and sound nice when you read the description and reviews, but they are absolute trash. I wouldn't even buy them for my kids.",138,1.0,2022,01,January,20
Loud,1,For the price it works fine and is comfortable. I can wear it for hours and it doesn't hurt. I have no idea about  noise cancelling. I'm not an audiophile or anything but it sounds fine to me for my needs. I have asked people on the other end if the mic sounds good and they say they can hear me fine. It is loud enough but I do wish it was able to get even louder for some uses. Rating it 5 stars for filling my needs but 4 stars on the gaming scale because while I can hear footsteps and surround sound I'm sure it must not be as good as a Turtle Beach or something. I've also had it for 1.5 years and no issues. No idea about the lights because I've never plugged that in.,139,5.0,2022,01,January,20

"Awesome, absolute deal for the price!",6,"I wrote a negative review for this purchase. Company reached out to me and offered a replacement free of charge. While I really appreciate the replacement, I found the new set of headphones had the same issue as the original. Choppy sound is not an ideal way to immerse yourself into a game.I truly appreciate the company's effort, but I can't recommend this product.",64,5.0,2022,01,January,20
Great durable headphones!,3,This thing sucks You have to be to close to the system for comfort I tried it on my ps5 and it doesn’t work at all for ps4 I’m not satisfied especially with how close to have to be to use the head set in the ps5 because in order to turn it on it has to be plugged into the back and the cord to plug into the controller isn’t very long at all so my hands had to be right up in the ps5 and it’s wasn’t comfortable at all,92,5.0,2022,01,January,19

Great customer service,3,"For gaming and even for non-gaming, a gripe I have about this headset is the volume and mic controller. It’s like you have a remote control super glued on the cord and it swings around and knocks up against your arm or chair. The USB cable is also an annoying addition. It’s cool for people who want glowing headsets but for people who don’t need to waste the energy for the lights, it’s an additional cord just hanging off of your laptop or desktop. So the design could definitely be better.As for the noise cancellation, I’m not completely sure what noise cancelling these headsets actually have. I tested the mic and even with the mic all the way up, you have to manually mute yourself using the volume controller; otherwise, people can still hear you but you will seem like you’re far away from the computer.The sound quality is okay. I played games and watched movies with these. While watching shows/movies with just the AUX 3.5 mm jack, I did notice some voice echoing. This isn’t super ideal depending on what you are trying to watch or listen to but some people may enjoy this.The headset does have cushy padding on the ears but it seems pretty small so for those with larger ears, these might be more of on-ear headphones rather than over-ear ones. The cushion does eventually hurt to keep the headset on for an extended period of time but I’m hoping after wearing the cushion down a bit, the comfortability will increase.Overall, the headset is okay. Since I got it on sale, it’s a decent set of headphones.",271,5.0,2022,01,January,19

Good,1,**UPDATE**I have finally tried with my PC and I tried on both mine and my husbands and the sound works fine. It’s not very noise canceling but it is nice to hear the base and actually pick up on detail I otherwise wouldn’t have heard without it. The downfall is that the mic won’t work at all. I of course played with the toggle and made sure it wasn’t my computer settings and it still isn’t working. I put in for a return so hopefully this one is defective and the new headset will be better. I’m super bummed because I really wanted to like this headset.I bought this gaming headset specifically for my ps4 and as advertised it states that it is compatible and it is not. I have the original sony PS4 controllers so it’s not even like I’m using off brand. I’ve tried with both of my controllers and nothing. I have not tried with my PC yet. Will update my review once I try it with the PC,172,5.0,2022,01,January,17

Great headset,2,"Upon receiving these I was so excited to see these lit up while I use them to game on my Xbox. The design of them is bisually appealing upon unboxing. The pink looked a little cheap but I’m sure the other colors with black would have been better. I was saddened to discover that in order for them to light up you have to plug them into a USB, which the splitter for this is very inconveniently placed close to the controller and the cord is extremely short. So that was a big 👎🏼. After being bummed about that I shrugged it off and started gaming with them anyway. I got 5 minutes into my game when sound started breaking up. Another 5 minutes later and they completely stopped working. Tested my old headset just to be sure and the old worked, verifying the headset was junk.

Do not buy this headset,5,Excelente,1,1.0,2022,01,January,03
Mic doesn't work with ps4,5,My daughter loved the headphones!! Its comfy and lights turn on when connected to PC. Works well with her xbox remote also so its a win all around,28,1.0,2022,01,January,03
Excelente,1,"So when reading the reviews, I seen a bunch of BAD ones that were posted recently and it honestly scared me. I still got them anyways because I don’t mind for how long they last but the mic is pretty good, for now. I take care of my stuff so I’ll make this mic last for the time I need it for. But it’s a 10/10 from me so far…",70,5.0,2022,01,January,03
Great bargain here,3,"Sound is muffled.Lights - vibrant but useless unless you're connecting to a laptop.  For gaming,  the split is too short to connect it to the console  (what makes it light up) and simultaneously to the gaming controller (what makes it useful) . So for gaming, the lights will not be on while wearing the headset.Mic - like so many other complaints, doesn't work.Returning this item.",65,5.0,2022,01,January,02
Pretty good especially for the cost,6,"The product broke, no sound.  Called to trouble shoot was told by Amazon it was sold by third party seller and to contact them.  The only contact is a link to the instruction manual. Very frustrated.  Save your money and do not buy.",43,4.0,2022,01,January,01

Perfect for gaming! Great value for the price! Great for kids.,11,I bought these for my son to use when playing the game and he loves them. They do cancel out the noise so sometimes he has one ear on and one ear off. I’m a yeller so he can usually hear me with them on. The mic is clear when he is talking during the game.,56,5.0,2021,12,December,31

Super simple for my son to use and he loves them,11,"I wanted to love these headphones because I saw so many good reviews.  Fresh out of the box those blue lights were super cool.  I appreciated that they came with the adapter for headset jack or mic/headphone jacks.  The headset itself was comfy and fit well.  I could hear everything else great....except myself.  Default I couldn't hear myself at all.  I knew to change my windows settings to increase the microphone volume, but unfortunately, the mic quality is just not there.  I tried to use them to game with my friends and they said I sounded worse than the last, much cheaper headset that I had.**UPDATE:  I returned this headset over 6 months ago and the company has directly emailed me FIVE times claiming their product has 'since improved' and keeps offering me compensation to update/take down my Amazon review.  (Read into this as you will.)  I am not interested, please stop emailing me.",154,5.0,2021,12,December,30

Sound goes in and out after only 2 months of use,11,"It says so in the info, but if you're like me you go right to reviews lol. I have tested it with my ps4, fits great over my glasses.

Great budget headset!,3,I bought this headset a few days ago and this is by far the worst headset I have ever owned the sound in game is horrible and my friends can hear my in game sounds though the headset also it hurts my ears the padding is not very good I can’t stand this headset I threw mine in the trash and will be buying a different one.,67,5.0,2021,12,December,28
The Microphone is absolutely terrible,5,The microphone doesnt work with PS4.  I went through all of the troubleshooting steps twice and the mic is digital garbage at best and completely unresponsive at worst.Wish I had looked deeper into the reviews before adding to my wish list and having people waste their money on this product,50,1.0,2021,12,December,28
Perfect gaming headphones,3,Excelente,1,5.0,2021,12,December,28
My Son Son loves it. Its the best.,8,Perfect for gaming. Can hear all the shots in the distance. Dial in where footsteps are coming from at distance and still can’t hear my wife nagging me about how adults shouldn’t play video games from the other side of the couch,42,5.0,2021,12,December,28
Horrible,1,I used these headphones mainly for gaming on my Playstation but they worked just as good on my pc. I've bought more expensive gaming headphones and these can compete with those except for the noise canceling but it's not bad. The long chord gives you room for gaming from a distance and the volume control on the chord is nicely placed. The led lights looks pretty nice and the fact you have an option to use them or not but still use the headphones is a nice addition.,88,1.0,2021,12,December,28
Mic isn't rotatable,3,"My son loves them so much! The color is so bright when they light up and he says it's like having a surround set up all to himself! Plus they appear to be made well and fairly durable, which is great for my ten year old boy!",47,3.0,2021,12,December,26
Cheaply Made,2,"These do not cover the ears well and therefore , let in lots of sound from the outside. I am coming from an old pair of HyperX headphones.

Not worth it,3,"I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend! yes they look very nice, but they slip of your head continuously. The microphone quality is absolute trash, who ever you try talking to, they will not be able to hear you. You can barely hear with these, I set to the highest volume it allows, and it’s so quiet. I did end up returning it and buying a Sony brand headset those were 10/10!",74,1.0,2021,12,December,24

Decent head set,3,Bought for my son. Works great and sound is also great. Was really quiet on the xbox until we realized you can turn the vume up on the console. Overall it's great for my 8 year old. Would recommend!,39,4.0,2021,12,December,21

Sound is good,3,"Perfect for gaming, watching shows on his Kindle, or listening to music!",12,5.0,2021,12,December,19
Everyone needs,2,"I have only purchase it for about 3 weeks and this headset …sucks.  I plug it into my ps4 controller and for some reason it keeps messing with the controller.(it keeps automatically scrolling up and down like you are holding down the R-stick). The sound and mic are fine so far but not woth it when you have trouble selecting an option in a game (I have to unplug the headset to be able to select, then plug it back in)",81,5.0,2021,12,December,19
It’s good quality,3,the headset is comfortable and good for the money. only complaint is how large the volume and mute button is. i compared it to a roku remote and as you can tell it is fairly large for only 2 things on it. good product tho :),46,3.0,2021,12,December,18

"Great for music, 4/5 for gaming",6,Comfortable. Easily adjust volume. Bass/ Sound is AMAZE BALLS!!,9,4.0,2021,12,December,15
Honestly great!,2,I didn’t expect too much but the headset broke within a week.,12,5.0,2021,12,December,15
It didn’t even work,4,"I am by no means a headset snob. I have some specifications that I want met for a gaming headset. These headphones check a lot of boxes, but not all of them. Unfortunately, I will be looking for a new headset because:1. The microphone is pretty muffled, I am in a party chat 5-7 days a week. My friends have stated that the mic is muffled and kind of muddy.2. Louder sounds make their way through the mic. For example: gunshots, loud animal calls in a hunting game, loud screams/effects from a scary game, etc.3. The mic is fixed. This is obvious with the photos, but I didn't realize how much it would effect me. I can't adjust how close or far the mic is from my mouth, and therefore can't really try to fix mic quality.4. The plastic quality is ""ehh..."" It feels a little cheaper, but you get what you're paying for with a budget headset.5. The bass was not all that impressive. I have had a lot worse, but also much better as well. I'd say it's a 6/10 bass rating, and this is one of the most important features for me.*Everything else about the headset is great, but I don't recommend it for gaming with friends. Their best features include:- Long, braided cord- Crisp, loud and powerful sound- Comfortable and light with great quality earmuffs- Great designCons:- Fixed mic- Bad mic quality- Not best for a really small (losing sound quality) or really large (losing comfort) head- Lacking ""amazing"" bass",254,1.0,2021,12,December,15
Mic would not work,4,"Lasted about 2 months, we bought a cheap headset knowing they wouldn’t last long, my son is hard in headsets so at this point it’s better to order cheap and replace often instead of really expensive ones that still don’t last.

MIC DOESN’T WORK,3,"Couldn’t beat the price on this headset. I just wanted something cheap that would work decent. Of course it seems like pretty cheap plastic but it doesn’t really bother me. They don’t hurt my head/ears or anything like that when I wear them for long periods of time, unlike other headphones/headsets. They light up which is cool, but you can’t plug that part into a controller because it’s a USB for the lighting. Overall, I haven’t had any complaints from the people I play with online. No comments about how bad it sounds or anything so I’m assuming the mic works just fine and so does the sound that comes through the headset.",113,1.0,2021,12,December,12
Boyfriend loves them!,3,"I received the Kotion Each by Bengoo headphones last Christmas as a gift.  I thought for sure these were $70-$100 headphones when I tried them on my PS4.  They sounded great and gave my girlfriend peace because she now did not have to hear RDR2 constantly.  I could fish, ride horses, hunt, and have shootouts with outlaws all day long.  I do not play online, so I cannot say to the microphone quality, but I have used it a few times on zoom calls and no one had issues hearing me.  I am also a musician and filmmaker and I am VERY picky about sound quality.  Let's be clear...crystal clear (get it?)...these are NOT $500 Sennheiser headphones, but they are VERY good quality for the price, for casual use.  I could not believe the price when I looked them up.  Would I edit an album or film with these?  Yes, for rough cutting.  But I would grab something more reputable for sound final mixing for video and definitely not use these for sound mixing music.  The mix coming out of these is a little on the bass-y side for me, but not enough one couldn't get used to in a few minutes.  And I only know they are slightly bass-y because my ear is trained to hear that stuff.  Most people will not notice this at all.  They have lasted just fine for a year and are still going.  Light plastic body, but nothing has fallen off it yet.  I also take very good care of my things and do not toss them on tables/couches etc, so I cannot speak to how robust they are for people who like to throw things across rooms.  I do not ever pull on the cord, etc.  Mine came with a split connector (3.5mm/USB) which does come in handy sometimes, but the extra dangly cord not being used can be annoying.  Also, the cord is waaaaay long. 7.5 feet-ish?  Which is great, and also annoying, depending on your usage.  But I would take more cord than not enough any day.  The in-line volume knob is great for when different streaming services like to pump out different volumes and your ears get blasted when your show starts...no need to get up and change the computer volume...just lay on the couch and adjust the dial on the cord.  Reversely the dial is great to pump up the volume a bit for those highly compressed videos on the web that are too low to hear.  Overall it gets 4 stars.  If it had a treble/bass adjustment knob, it would get 5.  Cheers to your ears!",438,5.0,2021,12,December,12
Broke after 3 and half months of use.,8,I like everything about them,5,3.0,2021,12,December,11
Works for little bit,4,The headset is really comfortable. It feels natural on the head. My friends can hear me really well when I play and I hear them just fine. You can hear what's going on out side the headset but not real well. I use it for gaming and I really like it. Over all a really good headset.,57,2.0,2021,12,December,11
Sick of cheap amazon headphones with broken microphones.,8,Good audio and mic quality for a cheap price. Also comes with the adapter for PC use. Only complaint I have is the earmuffs are a little small and hurts my ears after extended sessions.,35,1.0,2021,12,December,11
Headset,1,First you can either have the headset glowing or you can actually use the mic. Pick one you cant have both. Secondly maybe its just mine but my headset is completly lopsoded. Crocked however you want me to say it. Third due to it being uneven sound quality isnt great. No noise cancelation and its not as loud as i would like it. Last its uncomfortable period,67,5.0,2021,12,December,08

Great headphones,2,"The headphones are amazing, bass boosting is insanely good. HOWEVER. The Microphone, in a little over a week of having this headset, began to crackle and cut out, my friends kept telling me they couldn't hear me or outright telling me that all they got was static and crackling. I tried everything from updating my drivers, to tampering with sound settings, to reseating the audio cables into different ports, the only conclusion I was left with was the cable was somehow so poorly made that it failed in just over a week.I am extremely disappointed. $50 I could've spent somewhere else.

Good,1,"So definitely 5 stars here. The sould it's really good. They even fit my big head! 1 issue. I never thought I had big ears.

Great!,1,"Do not buy this mic. I’m someone who always checks reviews. With this device, check the questions. Apparently, you need an adapter to use the headset in the first place, which the seller does not include. Secondly, even with the adapter, most say that the mic stops working after a little while even with the adapter. I highly recommend avoiding this product.",62,5.0,2021,11,November,27

It WILL break.Also They didn't have the giant USB portion of the wire in the photos, I had to cut it off,Thus was advertised as pc AND CONSOLE headphones,Do any of you know a console controller with a USB port for led lights on headphones?Didn't think so.Don't buy these for console, and go ahead and rip the microphone off,",103,1.0,2021,11,November,26
Junk,1,"I have been through a few gaming headphones (other brands) for my boys! These are really great quality. Sound, wire, and sound canceling features make this product worth it and great price.",32,1.0,2021,11,November,25
This works for meetings not just gaming,7,"When I bought this headset, the mic is very bad and when I talked in it my friends could barely hear me, I would have to scream into the mic for them to hear me. Also, in order for the led lights to work you have to have a pc. Also, it says there's noise cancelation and when I tried, I could hear everything my friend said behind me and he was whispering, the sound quality is ok but not good enough for almost $40. The bass sucks too. 2/10 Would not recommend.",93,5.0,2021,11,November,24

Good quality,2,"Works well but the cord is very clunky. These are stylish and easy to use, but the cord is very thick and heavy.

Amazing! Overall your getting a razer headset for 20 bucks,10,"This is the best gaming headset we have purchased to date. Durable, good noise cancellation, great sound. We’ve had these for a little over a year and compared to others we’ve gotten on Amazon with great reviews, these are the only ones that live up to their 4-5 star ratings. We now own the orange and the purple pairs and have recommended this particular set to friends who have purchased as well. Good buy, can’t say enough good things :)",80,5.0,2021,11,November,09
Microphone doesn't work,3,This a cheaper yet good quality head set. I use it for gaming and it works well. The mic doesn't work well on PC but that's ok because I don't use the mic. One side of the headphones stopped working at one point but I just had to unplug it and plug it back in.,55,1.0,2021,11,November,09

Great value,2,I got the headset because I needed one for work meetings.  Wanted to drown out the noise when in a meeting.  It does that and keeps the folks in the meeting from hearing the background noise and I get the extra focus.  Not gaming but still works.,47,4.0,2021,11,November,08

"Great sound,but the mic stop working again!",7,"After a while(month or two) of using the mic no problems I've noticed when I'm outside of a discord call on my pc it would turn up the game I'm playing like Roblox and spotify to extreme extents and the sound quality would dip kinda just making me not wanna use them outside of a call so now I just close my laptop but always stay in a call. Idk why this is a problem for me maybe because it changes to a mode when you are in a social media call but otherwise the headset is Greta for it's price, mic is a bit loud tho!",107,1.0,2021,11,November,06
They work really well sound sound good and they’re comfortable I was surprised,13,I've never used a high quality headset but this one has been a huge upgrade from using regular ear buds. The downside is that the cable is heavy and constantly pulling on the headset. It really needs a clip to attach cable to your shirt.,45,5.0,2021,11,November,06
Awesome for ps5,3,These are great. We use them on an old Xbox one for Fortnite and also on a laptop. One of the better headsets we have gotten.,26,5.0,2021,11,November,06

"Great price, surprising quality",4,Disappointed in these headphones. Save your money and get better quality headphones. It sounds good if you're just listening to it but when you have the mic on its horrible (I play COD on Ps4). So much static and background noise you can't even hear me.,46,5.0,2021,11,November,02
Good,1,These are horrible. If you are a gamer these are not for you invest in better,16,5.0,2021,09,September,16
Not terrible/not outstanding,3,"Would not recommend these to anyone. They are too small and put way to much pressure on your ears. Lights are just a gimmick, she your money and search around for something better.",33,4.0,2021,11,November,02
Good service,2,"I bought these about a year ago and when I received them they appeared to be fine but when I used them the cord is heavy, thick, and tugging. The worst part is that if you ever take off the black wrap around the cord the cord will dwindle and tangle until it decides to do it until it permanently damages itself. I used them for about 5 hours one day and never touched them even though they were annoying and I noticed in a video clip I saved, the microphone cut out randomly but audio still coming through the headset and I was confused because I never did anything to damage them so they eventually damage themselves by tangling. I asked my dad to get me another pair of headphones and I told him not the same ones but by the time they had already arrived it had been the same and he didn't realized that he bought the same pair but I figured I'd give them another shot. Once again they tangled themselves to death one day and I realized how cheap this company was and how terrible their products are and how cheaply made they are. If there is anything in this review you note down, DO NOT BUT THESE HEADPHONES. The worst part is them tangling beyond repair and the annoyance of the excess weight to the cord. Quite embarrassing for the company to own such a terrible product.",243,4.0,2021,11,November,01
"Great sound, but not great for Eye Glasses",8,The microphone does not work.

"I'm not allowed to review this, so I'm giving it 1 star",12,Got this because I figured I'd have better luck with connectivity while playing Call Of Duty on the PS4... yet I can be standing close to a box and barely hear the sound of it let alone enemy footsteps. (Yes I have the sound at 100 in the game settings and the volume dial turned all the way up.)Sending it back for a refund.,64,1.0,2021,10,October,29
The chord is extremely extremely long,6,On the outside this headset looks great and fits comfortably. I'm not sure if mine is defective or just had something come loose in shipping but it doesn't quite work right. The microphone works fine and the left earpiece works fine. The rights side is where the problem is; I have to move the cord just right to hear out of it. If this was a $30 headset I'd say it's fine but for $50 I feel like I should at least be able to hear out of both sides without having to do a yoga position to get it to work properly. Overall I'd say it's not bad but also not great. Do with that what you will.,119,3.0,2021,10,October,26

He uses them on his PS4 to play mainly Fortnite.,18,I thought these were really good at first but the same week I went to Burlington coat factory and found a turtle beach headset For $30 once I tried those on I noticed a big difference …..these ones have a lot of background noise there is an echo that doesn’t go away and just the quality it’s different I would go for a different brand. Returned this pair.,68,4.0,2021,10,October,25

It's....not great. (Edit: Customer service makes up for it),9,Don’t waste your time with this cheap ass headset. I was expecting something to at least work when I unboxed it and was disappointed. I even wasted my time reading the manual and watching a YouTube video to make sure it was “on”. I’m a 20 year old college kid who just needed a mic to play with my friends but I’m just gonna say whatever and buy a quality one from Best Buy.

Perfect buy for now long as it last longer than a day like other brands.,15,"Worked great at first with both my PC and Xbox. Sound was way better than my old headset. After one day it started having problems. It either would not work at all or the mic would not work. Cheap chinese junk, but I did not want to spend a ton on a headset so I rolled the dice.EDIT: Bengoo customer support reached out to me multiple times and offered a refund. I continued to troubleshoot the headset and got it to work with my XBox by buying a new Xbox controller. The microphone still does not work with Discord on my PC however. Changed rating to 3 stars.",108,5.0,2021,10,October,22
Mic Stopped working... UPDATE: Great Customer Service You Have...,9,I don’t know why I expected so much… maybe because of the decent amount of good reviews but these were absolutely trash.

However, I bought this headset for my work from home job, meaning I need the mic. I performed a mic test, and discovered that the mic doesn’t work. I disabled the built-in mic on my HP PC to ensure sound was coming solely from the headset mic. I heard a low scratchy version of my voice. Gave 2 stars bc music sounds great in the headphones and it feels high quality. I’m returning them bc the mic is about 5 1/2 inches of trash.",101,1.0,2021,10,October,21

Microphone doesn't work,3,"Super cute for an easy cheap alternative to a gaming headset. The sound quality is definitely not bad for the price.

they gave me a refund,5,"Ok so I'm just going to avoid beating around the bush and get right to it. The headset is acceptable, especially given the current $25 pricetag, but it's not great, it's really not. I have sensitive ears, had problems with them relating to heat and pressure, so I avoided headphones/sets for a while, but eventually saw how for the world of gaming, headsets dominate over earbuds so I have been on the lookout for a comfortable one ever since (lil beating around the bush there I know, no more I swear).Good:The top headrest part is very soft and squishy, we like this. It's blue. I love blue. The cord is well made, doesn't look like it's tearing anytime soon.Bad:They're not that comfortable, they're not torturous, but I have skullcandy headphones that are way easier to wear.Game sound is very average, can hear decently, but for games like Fortnite that have bad audio to begin with this isn't going to change anything.Ugly:I don't know if this is a defect, but if you plug this into your phone or tablet, and bend the cord a lil while on call, it'll hang up. You watching a youtube video? Cord moves slightly and it skips to the next video. You see how infuriating this can be.It's a 2 pronged connection. They have added a usb connection ONLY for the lights, I get it but at the same time just remove the lighting,  no one wants to have a usb cord swinging everywhere when not using it on pc.The mic doesn't mute when you flip it up. I thought this was an industry standard but apparently not, you have to manually mute your mic with the switch on the panel that dangles on your cord.So that's pretty much it, honestly you'd be getting around the same quality with a $10 clearance pair at your local electronics store, and without the very annoying end call bug. Would have returned but was too lazy. Eh it'll work as a backup I suppose.Edit: BENGOO's customer service took the initiative and contacted me giving out a refund to my amazement. I was concerned it was possibly a scam but they worked with me to refund me without compromising any personal information whatsoever. Huge thanks to BENGOO for having the service more popular companies should have.",386,1.0,2021,10,October,18
"Got a faulty one, but the vendor replaced it!",9,Wire is a good length but sad that it only lights up when plugged in to a computer by USB. The headphones extension is short in my opinion. Have to pull down all the way and it just barely fits on my head. Overall for the money I paid I think I got a good deal,56,5.0,2021,10,October,18

More than I expected tbh,5,"Sadly, no one said in the comments that the sound is piss poor and no one can hear you speak.

Sound went out after 2 days,6,The quality is amazing.  I bought them for my fiancé for our PlayStation.  He loves these headphones.,17,2.0,2021,10,October,14
The sound is amazing,4,I really liked these headphones but after only having them for a couple months the mic stopped working. They can’t hear me at all but I can hear other players. It glitches in and out often. They were great until they completely stopped working.UPDATE:Tried to give me a half bribe to take down my review so y'all can buy more of these cheap headphones! I paid more than 30$ for them..,71,4.0,2021,10,October,14
Garbage,1,"Purchase this for my grandson, he takes excellent care of all of his gaming equipment, unfortunately these only lasted a couple weeks and stopped working. I’m very disappointed because I cannot get a refund or an exchange",37,1.0,2021,10,October,14

GREAT Headset,2,I actually have to walk up to my grandson before he hears me. These are great.,16,5.0,2021,10,October,13
It’s pretty good,3,Microphone doesn't work at all. doesn't even show up in my ability to locate and change settings on devices to use the microphone. As well as the switch to mute the mic doesn't work because my computer can only use the mic from the computer. This headset is a real let down. I just go back to using my bluetooth headset that's more comfortable and i can walk around in but without a mic on it. If I'm required to be at the computer to use the mic anyway.,89,4.0,2021,10,October,13

Sounds is great! Mic is clear.,6,Works beautifully. Has same problem all head phones have. HOW LONG BEFORE THE CABLE SNAPS AND THE JACK FALLS OFF?! I took some tooth picks and electrical tape to make a sort off splint around the jack. Confident it will hold. If you have the same problem with head phones try that method. 5/5 stars 👍,56,5.0,2021,10,October,11

Best headset,2,"Pros: Sound quality is decent, the in-line volume control is convenient, and they look really cool.Cons: At least my particular headset had a constant static noise even when I use the mute switch on the volume control.

"Sound decent, microphone terrible",4,I bought 2 & you can’t hear anything on either one of them. My husband & daughter play Xbox with each other in separate rooms.

We replaced hers with a Turtle Beach also & now they just sit.,76,2.0,2021,10,October,06
Son loves it,3,So far it stood up to my 9 year old he bought these  with his Christmas money for his fortnite an every chance he gets he is playing any game or movie has them on since the pandemic an being in virtual school and not really having any friends this was perfect for him to be able to interact and play with some friends that we knew personally an other people [should definitely be sectioned out in age groups DEFINITELY NOT THIS COMPANYS FAULT BY ANY MEANS] he isn't  very easy on them either I'm sure I've heard them dropand hit our very hard floors no less that 40 times an still going strong,114,5.0,2021,10,October,06

Really good,2,"I bought this, as I needed a replacement headset that utilized USB connections.This uses 3.5mm connections for audio.  The USB connection just turns on the LEDs.  So it looks great, but doesn't do jack.In addition, the headset itself is uncomfortable.  Heaven help you if you already have a headache and you throw a pair of these on.Congratulations to the manufacturers; I have never returned an item to Amazon before this one.  You have won the prize.",76,5.0,2021,10,October,04

Love it,2,These do NOT work with computers. Windows does not recognize them and no software exists to help. You can hear people but the mic does not let people hear you.  They work great on laptops. The mic and lights are problematic. Noise canceling and comfort are spot on with everything except computers.,52,5.0,2021,10,October,03
Awesome for the price you pay,6,"The mic had very low input signal when it worked, but mostly it would cut out and not work at all.",21,5.0,2021,10,October,02
great,1,Update....I received a replacement pair after the mic on the first was static-y.  My son uses these for gaming so the mic is really important.  The mic was exceptionally clear. Sound is great too.  Very pleased especially for the price..,40,5.0,2021,10,October,02
Doesn’t last very long,4,Worked ok for a month. Now there is background noise and a bad echo,14,2.0,2021,10,October,02
Good Headset!,2,"I love this headset, it’s very good for music and gaming. Even if it only seems to support standard Sony controllers, so I couldn’t use my custom controller with it. But it’s no big deal, it still lets you hear things, you just couldn’t use the mic since you didn’t come through. But the sound quality was really good and crisp, especially when it comes down to Bass, it was perfect.TLDR, Great as long as you have a Sony brand controller and nothing aftermarket.",84,5.0,2021,10,October,01
Great headset,2,For sure it’s nothing for professional gaming and music but for that value it’s really good.You can’t do anything wrong with if you don’t have high expectations and look for an spare device.My daughter is happy with.Good quality for good price,41,5.0,2021,10,October,01

Coming in clean,3,"most think this will work on a gaming console. Partially they will. but how the console is designed, there is no USB PORT NEXT TO AN AUDIO outlet.  there fore the player is left to choose between the lights on the earphones working or the audio working... and we all know audio is a must.  so all that is left....

its ok,2,Broke within a few months,5,3.0,2021,09,September,17
Not for Ps5,3,"Edit:Their customer service reached out after I posted the review saying they changed manufacturers and asked me to give them another shot. I tried them again, and while I still can't say they're noise canceling, the sound and fit are excellent for the price. The microphone quality is pretty nice too, a friend mentioned it makes gaming with me much easier lol. All in all, these are prolly $50-$60 headphones at a $30 price point, and the customer service is incredibly responsive.The sound is pretty good, and they fit well, but it blocks no sound whatsoever. If that's mainly why you're buying it, you'll want to look elsewhere. Even with sound playing i can hear background noise clearly",118,2.0,2021,09,September,28

Litterly the dollar store headset,5,Noise cancellation and output sound was fine.  However the microphone leaves a lot to be desired.  People on the other end could barely hear me and said i sounded like i was super far away.  There is also no way to adjust the microphone so that it sits closer to your face; it's in a fixed position.,57,1.0,2021,09,September,24

Sounds great. Mics good.

Great cheap headset!,3,"I think they are good especially for the price but I wish that they were more adjustable.  They are great for sitting up and listening to TV or gaming, but if you want to lay down or have them adjusted to your head they are not good.  They feel bulky and don't quite fit to my head.  For someone with a slightly larger head, they may fit.  However, with them not being adjustable I think my problem would be flipped if someone with a really large head put them on as they are not adjustable.  Also, the two connection types with one cord hanging all the time is just a huge bother, and it is definitely a design flaw.  There should be some way to tuck the unused connector up so it doesn't dangle and become a nuisance.  Sound, noise cancelling, and upright use is all good though.  I gave it a 3 because of these factors.",157,4.0,2021,09,September,16

Note as others mentioned the wording on the headset itself is different than in the picture displayed, but it is the same model.I would  5 star it if it was a little more comfy for long hours of use, but after an hour or two because of its weight and bulk, it really starts to become uncomfortable (for me).",76,1.0,2021,09,September,13

The plastic is brittle. The LEDS work as advertised, but it takes an entire usb port.

My son loves these!,4,I play PC and Xbox so I got this mic for gaming on both or one of them I didnt really care but I tried it on the PC first and it wasn't the best sound quality and I was trying to chat with people but that didn't go well so I tried on the Xbox hoping it would work better on there but nope it didn't so now I'm not getting this mic again cuz it was trash maybe I got a bad one idk so I got one from Walmart that work really good for everything I need it for amd it was like $37,107,5.0,2021,09,September,12

Very good quality for the price,6,"Final Update: I received a new headset and surprise, a working mic, this new headset also has better audio quality. Thankful they really care about their customers!! Thank you!Update: They saw my negative review and have emailed me to try to fix the problem with either a refund or replacement. Excellent customer service! I've decided to give them another chance and ask for a replacement. Will update with the results.For the price and what I needed to do, it works, however the mic doesn't even work at all. I ended up using my Antlion Mod Mic Wireless and it works fine. The sound is okay, but that's what you get for choosing price over quality.",115,5.0,2021,09,September,11

Great sound slightly uncomfortable,4,This would be a 5 star but in order to use light on headphones you have to plug it in & that wouldn't be bad but the cord to plug it into ur Xbox is SUPER short!! You would have to latterly but on top of the system to use it. Other than that they are fine. Don't buy this for the light because they probably won't be close enough to the TV to use it.,76,4.0,2021,09,September,11

No one can hear. Mic doesn’t work.,7, At this point I’d call this false advertising. I bought this to use on Discord. Unless you have room for 7 feet of cable and want to have that garbled my mike will never work sound quality don’t bother buying this piece of junk. Not to mention there are just so many things to plug in. It’s cheaply made and I’d get something better at dollar general. Waste of time.,70,1.0,2021,09,September,10

Is fine,2,"Awful. First thing, I opened the box, the headphones looked beautiful and I was so excited to try them out. I tried connecting them to my computer with one wire, didn't work, tried another, didn't work, finally worked with the extender thing. I called my friend to play Valorant after, he said the mic quality was AWFUL, and it is. The sound is also terrible. Can only hear through one side or the other at a time and they're extremely uncomfortable. Can barely adjust them, mic is very far from face. They would also disconnect constantly, and when they did I had to set them back up, they also crashed my game every time they disconnected. Do not buy. Not worth it.",122,4.0,2021,09,September,09

Pretty good,2,"Nice gaming headset for cheap. Mic works great, sound is great, and the options to use for Xbox, PS5, or computer is pretty sweet. My only gripe is the ""noise cancelling"" isn't anywhere near a Bose, Beats or JBL and if you have a pumpkin head like myself (it houses a BIG brain for gaming...duh), this headset can be a little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Overall 4/5 Stars and I'd buy again",76,4.0,2021,09,September,07
Makes A Great For Kids Who Love Gaming!,8,"The sound from the headphones are good however the microphone is BARELY picking up any sound.

Finally my computer noticed the headset in the Xbox controller, OH BOI I will give it another chance and have a 4 hour gaming sesh with my friends... Yeah about thatSpent an hour trying to fix the headset AGAIN! either no one could hear me, I was super quite Or I was breaking up so bad it was pointless to talk with this headset I basically spent the remainder time yelling over to my wife's headset (she was also playing with us) just for people to hear me! well awesome my voice is now shot for the night, coool.Oh and my ears, OMG is this headset uncomfortable to my ears, I don't think I have ever had a set that didn't completely cup my ears, Spoiler alert, these don't.

Sound cutting out,3,For me you had to have the headphone jack in a certain spot and stay still for the sound to stay on. It works only sometimes but the more you move the more it cuts out. But the sound was very clear and my party could hear me clear when it did work.,53,1.0,2021,09,September,05

Doesn’t work well. Son has to “hold it a certain way” to get it to work.,16,I've had this headset for less than 6 months and the mic has already started to go out. I have to have the cord a certain way for it to work. If the mic is working and I move the cord whoever is on the other end can hear ridiculous amount of feedback. I play on Twitch streams so it's great to go back to watch and all you can focus on is the feedback from this headset. Not worth the $30 I spent. I'd rather buy a Razer headset that'll cost me more in the beginning but I don't have to worry about it braleaking 6 months in.,109,3.0,2021,08,August,22

Also, The Cord Is Alil Long, Like 3 Foot Long. Wish It Was Shorter. There Is Also Two Connects At The End. It's Split With The Headphone Jack And A USB At The End Of The Cord. Not Really A Big Thing, But It Does Get In The Way Sometimes.",104,3.0,2021,08,August,20

The Audio is great for so cheap,7,Some reviews says these headphones are better than $100+ ones. No. They are not. I have Sony Studio Monitor MDR-7506 to compare with.Specs shows 15 Hz to 20 kHz. Not even close to 20 kHz. Sound like from metal barrel - without high frequencies and with over-boosted bass.Can not turn off LED light. There is a thing like a button on sound control box. I thought it should be LED switch button. It is not a button at all.,79,4.0,2021,08,August,18

Decent for the price,4,"The sound quality is great, but no matter what configuration of setting I change on my council. It still sounds like I am talking from across the room. The pickup on the mic just isn’t great.",36,3.0,2021,08,August,18
bruh,1,"I ordered these for myself.  My current headset's just reached the end of it's life and needs replaced.  These appeared similar and were near the same in price. But oh boy. The quality.  First off, unless you have an extremely tiny head, or are a child, these are not for you.  The ear cuffs are absurdly small, I had my Japanese roommate try them on and even he laughed at how ridiculously tiny they were. There's no way you could wear these for any length of time without getting a headache from the pressure to your ears. But hey, maybe they'll sound great and I can get past that.  NOPE! The audio was muffled and quiet, had to turn my volume up five fold to hear anything compared to my worn out set (The set that's literally falling a part sound better... come on....) All of this comes after waiting a much longer delivery time than quoted, by almost a week, and when the package DID arrive it was crushed.  Headset seemed unharmed, but with the sound quality, who knows maybe that's a factor.  I can't say. All I CAN say is that these are absolute junk.",197,1.0,2021,08,August,18

Good for the money.,4,They do feel cheap and that's ok for the price but the mic and sound are better than expected so you won't be disappointed of you consider the price. The mic is loud and clear and it does an amazing job at filtering my music playing on the background so it just picks up my voice and does not disturb other players.,62,4.0,2021,08,August,17
Great,1,The sound for the head set is ok but not good or amazing in any way. It’s hard to hear the people talk sometimes it sounds like they’re far away or something. It is also heavy on the cable side. It feels clunky dealing with it,46,5.0,2021,08,August,16

The switch to turn the mic on and off was touchy, he’d occasionally have to flip it back and forth to get it to work. He said sound was great and noise canceling was ok. The worst part is that he was using it today and the cable/cord just came apart. As far as I know it’s not fixable unless I get a soldering gun but I have no idea how to do any of that. We have one bummed kiddo.",98,1.0,2021,08,August,14

The volume sucks,3,Use for gaming.Noise cancellation could be better.,7,2.0,2021,08,August,14
it constantly disconnects from the controller,6,This is great for beginner gamers. The headset is comfy which is important because we use it for hours and hate when headsets gives headaches from the pressure. It does cancel outside noise pretty well but you can still hear a bit. Which I prefer since I would like to know if I’m being spoken to when playing. But you have to take headsets off to actually hear other people in the room.I like that you can use in the PC and PS because the headset Jack works with the PS4 remotes. Like others mentioned the usb has to be connected to light up. For us we don’t mind the light not being lit up so it’s not a big issue. After all when you are the user you really don’t look at yourself unless you are streaming live with face view and you want that extra flare.Only issue I had which isn’t a big issue is the mute for the mic isn’t easily accessible and the switch is sometimes hard to quickly use when gaming. For those times when you want to be muted so others don’t hear every background noise or family talking. So I find myself trying to switch between mute while playing which is hard when you are playing FPS games and in an intense section. But that might be me not able to multitask that quickly lol I just wished the mute button was a button possibly or the slide switch it does has was higher up the flush so you aren’t stumbling trying to slide (plus it doesn’t really feel like it slides all the way so you are double checking) I know I went into depth of the issue but it isn’t a huge issue. Just my input maybe when they decide to make another model they can put that into consideration.Overall love it! Going to buy a couple more for our gaming family.,321,2.0,2021,08,August,13
"It is cool, icy blue and soods good.",8,"I'm happy with this purchase, love the look of the headphones and enjoy the lights even though I can't really see them myself, I enjoy the fact that they are there and that people that walk into the room can see them.

It only lights up with the USB plug-in, meaning PC gaming & NOT console.I returned for a full refund within a week and actually have been getting by with the console stock headset. I suggest looking elsewhere, the deal isn’t worth you asking for twenty+ minutes, “can you hear me now?” for the second day in a row before giving up.

This headset is false marketing and criminal, the mic basically does not work.Additionally, the USB light up is ridiculous and an absolute waste of space.

Save your $,3,Product looks as described and is comfortable. However two main features are gonna mark this one as a return for me. The sound quality is bad for both the incoming and outgoing mic audio. Everything sounds echoey like its in a fish bowl. Also the mute function does not work. Game audio itself is fine but not great but i got these for chatting and wont be able to use it this way. Pay more get more I suppose.,79,1.0,2021,07,July,28

Good headphones!,2,"Not really worth it since the extra wires get in the way, if your buying for xbox or playstation it’s terrible because not only do the lights not work but you need to plug the usb into your consol, without a plug for the usb it just gets extremely annoying to use, the sound quality’s okay for the price.",59,5.0,2021,07,July,28
Good for gaming noise blockage I got blue it lights up and my son really can't hear me,18,They look cool but are for a child or a person with small ears had to take them off and go back to my old ones after 10 min,29,5.0,2021,07,July,28
Decent,1,"While I was excited about the headset's sound quality, I could not wear it for more than a few minutes. It is extremely tight. As a result, it kept pressing on my glasses, shifting them around whenever I moved my head. Additionally, it pressed tightly on my earring, which became painful very quickly.If you have neither glasses nor earrings, I guess this is a good option.",66,3.0,2021,07,July,28

Decent but uncomfortable,3,Bought these to cancel out the loud music coming from my neighbors house.. and also my neighbor.. they work perfectly. Sometimes I forget I have them on.,27,3.0,2021,07,July,27
"Rather disappointing, especially at full price. Stay away and find a better option.",13,"Overall the set is fine, nothing ridiculous. You get what you pay for pretty much. Just needed a fair-priced pair to replace my blown out ones. Perhaps my biggest gripe about this product is that the volume knob is a total joke; there is very little range on the adjustment to the volume compared to how much the knob is able to turn. On the way to turning it up the majority of the time you’re turning the knob your volume is not adjusting. The range feels like it begins and ends within less than a third of the knob’s ability to turn in the “volume increase” direction.",108,2.0,2021,07,July,27

Microphone doesn’t work,3,This is the 3rd set I've had to purchase for my son in the last year.  We kept buying the cheap headsets and they would all last a couple months before the mic would quit working or the audio quality became really bad.  Finally broke down and bought him a nicer more expensive set and so far they are amazing at the quality and tech that is in those things.,70,1.0,2021,07,July,26
Sucks,1,I was trying to play the ps4 with my friend but I couldn’t here him and he couldn’t here me.,20,1.0,2021,07,July,25
Perfect purchase,2,"I did a lot of research, on Amazon, looking for a new (cheaper) gaming headset for my son. He seems to have the worst luck when it comes to cheaper gaming headsets but I guess you get what you pay for. However, with these, they work great. Sound quality is good, voice and mute work good. The lights do not light up unless you have the USB cord connected to another source. My son uses his for the PS4, so no lights for us. Doesn’t really matter though since he cannot see the lights anyway! They work and that’s what matters most! The extra connector does come in the box.",110,5.0,2021,07,July,25

Good headphones,2,I like my headset and for that price you can’t beat it,12,5.0,2021,07,July,24
Thank you,2,These headphones are great for gaming with my friends. I like that the microphone folds up and it works perfectly with my ps4. I would say that the passive noise cancellation is just due to the thick memory foam earmuffs which are nice but wanted to make it clear that they aren't active noise cancellation headphones.,56,5.0,2021,07,July,24

Ok,1,So I really like these head phones :)  I travel alot and they are useful on my switch and my phone.  My tv still has headphone jack so I can use it there too and then gaming on the computer too it's wonderful.  Headphones need to be made like this.

Great buy for starting out,5,"Bought this because it was suggested for its comfort, it said people with larger heads could wear it without the infamous head pinch. Was a snug fit for me, felt the pinch and the ear cups were too small. I was going to disregard it since it was fairly cheap. But then I tested it out... one of the headphones didn't work. And yeah, I made sure it wasn't on mono the the L and R were on and balanced.Returned.",80,5.0,2021,07,July,22
Half way even worth it lmao,6,"These do not fit on the head well. my head falls under the ""size fits most"" category in terms of hats, glasses, and headsets. This does not. additionally, they do not cancel any noise at all. Finally, the one i received had to have the mic put right to my mouth to pick up any sounds, no matter how much i played around with the settings. I understand that this is a cheap pair, but that doesnt mean that the product shouldnt work. Sound quality is alright.",87,3.0,2021,07,July,22

best headset for cheap !,5,These do not work for what I needed them for. We bought them to plug into a PS4 controller and they do not connect.,24,5.0,2021,06,June,24
DO NOT WORK,3,"IMHO, I think these are the best headphones for the price. They are extremely durable and can withstand many drops without a problem. My grandpa got them for me and I love them! They even come with a usb cable for LED lights and an adapter to be able to use the microphone and headphones at the same time. The headphone mic quality is actually really good for any type of work or gaming. So in my opinion, this product has a five star rating.",85,1.0,2021,07,July,21

Bad for ps4,3,Not great... they don't really fit snug on your ears. No noise cancelation. Not very loud for gaming. Mic works good.. light is cool. Probably good for kids. I thought it was a good deal on decent set.. but really they are just $16 headset. Ill.be returning them as they were not what I was expecting or hoping for and don't fit.,62,1.0,2021,07,July,20
Broke,1,They are decent but very uncomfortable.,6,1.0,2021,07,July,20
Bengoo G9000 Recommend,3,"Got these as an intended upgrade for a previous 15$ headset I got from Walmart. I wasn't expecting much, but I wish I had kept the Walmart headset now that I've tested these. They work just fine for video playback, no real complaints there. My main issues are how incredibly cheap they feel and how crummy the microphone is. The store page claims it has noise isolation to better pick up your voice, but from my basic voice recording tests comparing my laptop and this microphone, my laptop consistently provides louder, clearer results compared to this headset. There was still quite noticeable background noise in the headset's recording as well. There's also some design flaws with how the microphone is implemented; it is a completely rigid peice of plastic that only rotates vertically, so it just ends up hanging a good 5 to 6 inches from your mouth when deployed (yes, I got out a ruler and measured. It's that off). This is compared to other headset mics which can be adjusted as needed to sit much closer, and in front of your mouth instead of beside it.The cheap feeling is the next biggest flaw. Simply put, the glossy plastic used on the exterior of the muff housing reminds me of a cheap toy. The case on the connecting band is a bit better, being made from matte plastic, but not by much. The only things on this device that don't feel like they were slapped together for as low a material cost as possible are the ear mouths and the braided cord, which comes with nice plastic protectors for both the 3.5mm audio jack and the usb that powers the contractually obligated ""Gamer"" lights. I'd have honestly forgone the lights for better build quality on the muff housing, and a microphone that's actually somewhat flexible so I can actually hear myself speak.Overall:-Average playback quality. Nothing that would impress an audiophile, but nowhere near terrible. It's painfully average (and unfortunately that's more than can be said for the rest of the device).-Bad microphone design and quality. Just... don't bother. I got better results from the built in microphone array in my Thinkpad w530 from 2012 than I did with this thing.-El cheapo feel. Like a toy from a dollar store.Verdict:If you care about quality in your headset?Don't buy this. They sell this thing for 50$ at regular price. I got it for about half off with the amazon prime discount. Even still, I somewhat regret spending money on this thing, and I'd be leagues more disappointed had I paid the full asking price for it. It's barely worth it's weight at 25ish dollars, and there's no way it's worth the normal 50.If you just want something for discreet audio playback?Go find a better headset, or just settle for some earbuds. There's plenty of decent options for the latter under 20$ both in retail stores and online. This one isn't worth your time or your money. The only reason I'm even keeping this is because returning products has always been a pain in my experience, and because the headset itself technically works. But that's it. It's not even worth the hassle of chasing down a refund.",535,4.0,2021,07,July,20

My grandson said they were stellar!,6,"I ordered two pairs of these headphones, one for me and another for my brother. Not even two weeks and they've already ran their course.At first they were a bit tight on the head, enough to give headaches if not removed after a few hours. This eventually eased up as the first week went on.The real issue came in for us 13 days after first using them. Like many others have been saying here, one day the mic was fine, and the next day all of a sudden its quality was way lower than what it was prior. Audio then coming through lot more stuffy, and the mic having a hard time picking up any sounds at all. Only when I cranked up the decibel settings to max it was able to pick up feint sounds. One of them still works fine on our Xbox, but when it comes to PC they're both on the way out already.Will most definitely be looking elsewhere for our tech needs in the future.",170,5.0,2021,07,July,16

I don't have a small head and don't have a huge head and it slides down off my ears after some time. it's snug for about an hour. super light weight plastic junk. when I received them I thought what was in the box was a pack of 100 masks. wait and save your money and buy something that is actually worth your money for years to come.",129,5.0,2021,07,July,16

Good for the price,4,Bought this headset in February '21 and it stopped working/no sound comes through the headset at all in April '21 but my son didn't tell me about it until July 1st '21. He used it for his PS4.,38,4.0,2021,06,June,25
Thanks,1,"A bit heavy and awkward, but I would expect that at this price point. My only real complaint is in the cord design. I am using with PS4 and the cord splits in 2. One is a 3.5mm jack that plugs into the controller and supplies the sound, which works fine. The other is a USB jack that supplies power to the LED lights and should plug into the console. The problem is that the cord splits at the last 6 inches or so. If you want to use the USB for the lights, you need to either buy a separate USB extension or keep your controller at least 6 inches from your console, which is very impractical, if not impossible. Just bad design. It should split much further up the cord so that both can plug in to their appropriate places at the same time.I had 3 stars, but lowered to 2 because I don't like companies that offer money for reviews. They've been sending incessant emails saying they will refund $20 if I remove my review. How about you just make a decent product? My integrity can't be bought for $20!",193,5.0,2021,07,July,07

For gaming,2,"Headset worked fine for one month, and I’ve had it for 6+ months and it’s cutting in and out consistently. Not only the mic in parties but the speakers as well. I bought a hyperX 3+ years ago and it still works with little to no issues still. I DO NOT understand why the reviews for this product are so good, you tend to trust so many 5 star reviews but, I’m very upset with it. the worst part is I can’t get a refund at this point so it was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY.UPDATE: it broke 3 weeks after this review was posted",105,5.0,2021,07,July,07

Stopped working after 2 months,5,"I bought these for me and my boyfriend since we video call a lot. They are really good quality sound, distance background noise but doesn't silence it (which I like). Looks pretty cool. However I am returning them bc my boyfriend doesn't like the extra usb cord for the light and it's too bulky for his liking after seeing them in person. I saw complaints about the mic, it works pretty well, you just have to turn the volume up sometimesThe reason I deducted 2 stars was because I got those for my phone and you can't use them unless you take off the case, the metal is not long enough otherwise",112,1.0,2021,07,July,04
Great customer service,3,These headphones worked for about a week and then quit. I checked all the settings on my Xbox 1 and still could not get them to work. Not happy.,29,5.0,2021,07,July,04

I think it is bad business.,71,5.0,2021,07,July,03
Awesome,1,"I am writing the review on behalf of the comments made by my grandson. He stated they are stellar, feel so comfortable on, the microphone works excellent. He said he could hear things perfectly and keep the outside noise out. The look is awesome! He is happy to have upgraded to this headset. I was very happy with the price and quality. Would I buy them again? Most definitely, and I highly recommend for their performance, price, and look of this headset.",82,5.0,2021,07,July,03

Not for call center work,5,The microphones too quiet,4,3.0,2021,06,June,25
Great until the mic stopped working,6,"A pretty decent headset. I bought this headset having very very high hopes for the mic specifically, since my audio hadn't been the best just through my laptop microphone. But after using this headset for a month or two, I have realized that the mic isnt actually that great. It is mediocre at best, and it commonly cuts out in voice calls. The headset audio quality itself is honestly pretty good. The mute and volume wheel were very convenient, and you could really make your audio very loud with the volume wheel, which was a plus. I will say though that the led lights on the headset wont light up unless you plus the usb jack in, which was a big inconvenience for me when I was still using a wired mouse, and after reading the reviews they rarely add that note but maybe I just forgot to check the slides when buying. This headset is also very VERY bulky which is a personal ick for me when buying headsets, its definitely not for a minimalistic look, but I will say this is just a personal preference. Overall, its a mediocre headset. Since its only 20$ you get what you pay for but theres definitely better headsets out there for the same price. Or save up just a bit more money for a highquality medium-priced headset like the razer kraken x, steelseries arctics 1, or hyperx cloud alpha headset.",239,2.0,2021,07,July,03

Not What You Think,4,"The first headset I received was busted the sound barely worked in only one ear piece. So, I sent it back in for a new one. The return/receiving for the new headset was easy and quick.Now the bad part: The headset is lower quality than the description let on. I felt that the headset sound wasn't the worst, definitely a step up from an earbud headset. The mic, however, doesn't past any quality test of mine. I have always had an easy time of speaking to my team/friends but after getting this they could barely hear me. They described it as if I were across the room trying to speak into the mic (I obviously wasn't). I was disappointed with my purchase. Definitely going to purchase a new headset from a more reputable company.",134,2.0,2021,06,June,21
Comfortable,1,"The headsets volume is terrible and the people you play with will barely be able to hear you even if you max the output volume on it.

Updated experience,2,"This product fits like a dream compared to the Razer Kraken line of headsets. The mic isn't as adjustable, but I prefer a fixed mic as it won't wear as badly, and the mic quality seems comparable if not superior.

Noise canceling is great,4,This product has to be plugged into the Xbox and controller at the sametime to work. It has about 2 inches of cord making it impossible to play any games.,30,4.0,2021,06,June,15
Good product,2,"I bought these because I play RPGs via Discord and wanted a better mic than my Galaxy Buds+ because sometimes they don't pick up my voice. From the very first night I used this headset, people said there was an echo and they could hear themselves on my mic. It was quite distracting, and I ended up having to switch to my earbuds. I thought that was weird, maybe just a problem with Discord? But I would try some solutions and see if I could get them to work.I used them a little since then and no one said anything, but I kept myself muted unless I was actually speaking. Then my boyfriend complained about hearing YouTube through the mic to the point where it was VERY loud for him when I could barely hear the video myself. I wondered if it might be my Macbook Pro. I did some research to see if there was a setting I could change, or anything else to fix the problem. Nothing did.Then I thought about seeing if other people had had the same problem by checking the reviews. After reading them, I'm convinced the headset has an insane amount of noise leakage and is just bad quality all around. I'm starting the process of returning them through Amazon, because I don't have any faith that the seller will respond or offer me any satisfaction. Bring on the cash offers, but this review is going nowhere.",243,5.0,2021,06,June,15

Nice,1,Good value for the money. Sound quality is Ok.  Cord seems ridiculously long but perhaps it’s because it works on the PC too (using for Xbox). Comfortable to wear.  Kind of big in size so if it’s for a kid just know it may be enormous on them.,48,5.0,2021,06,June,13

only works via 3.5 jack,5,"While these headphones offer great value, I would recommend them to anyone but gamers. This is annoying while gaming because they are VERY loose and gets you distracted.

In each box they’ll include a little flier saying you’ve won a free product. To receive it you need to leave a good review. While they do indeed follow through and give you the product, it’s a harmless scam to get positive reviews for their bad products. Spend the money on a better product.",79,4.0,2021,06,June,09

"It’s pretty good, but....",4,"They’re uncomfortable, and seem really fragile. The cord looks sturdy in the photo, but is actually somewhat flimsy. They’re not noise canceling either. I tried them as soon as I got them, and it was a big disappointing",38,4.0,2021,06,June,07
Highly recommend!,2,Not working after just a few months. Would not buy again.,11,5.0,2021,06,June,07
Durability not all it claims to be,7,"The sound quality is ""ok"", and by that I mean there is some surround sound, left/right, but not so much full directional, and that's pretty important to know.Teammates said mic sounded ok. Downside is the mic is short and stiff, maybe that will protect it better? The mic is adequate and good for the price.Now for the meat of this review... THE EAR COVERS ARE STIFF AND TINY. They wrap around my 3 year olds ears great, not mine though! It's actually PAINFUL to wear these longer than 30 minutes, so don't plan to game long with these. If you have tiny ears, or are under 10 years old, then these are for you. Of you're an adult, move on.I ended up spending 3X more for a Razer Kraken headset and omg let me tell you, for 3X the price I think I got 10X the value. The sound quality of the Razer headset is just miles ahead of these garbage bengoos. You try these trashy bengoos and then try some razer krakens with 7.1 surround and you will blow your mind of the quality difference. Not just in sound quality, but also in build quality, the mic, the comfort of the ear muffs, just wow, I would have paid 10X the price difference if I knew beforehand how big a difference there is between trashy cheap bengoos and actual good quality headsets like Razer... Never going back from Razer, I'll buy them again and again for life now that I know.",252,1.0,2021,06,June,07

This head set I wore for 6 hours straight and never got a headache and my ears didn't hurt. Clients voices were clear.

Cheap but reliable,3,Amazing customer service. I had an issue with the 1st pair of head phones. I was happy with the sound quality and production value of the headphones; however the set I received was very tight against my ears causing them to hurt after only an hour our two. I posted a review of my experience and a BENGOO representative reached out to me. They sent a brand new pair at no additional expense and I am very happy with my new set. They fit properly and are very comfortable.They have great dynamic sound. I primarily use these for online gaming and am able to clearly identify if sneaking up behind me. The mic is very clear and cancels out background noise very well.I would highly recommend this product - both for the quality and the amazing customer service,138,4.0,2021,05,May,28

Great item and value,4,"It’s pretty good when you are in the game and need to listen to your teammates talking, but when it come to REALLY needing a good ear, its, “Noise Cancellation” feature comes a bit short. It does dampen the noises outside fairly well, but not enough for certain games that need an attentive ear.But otherwise, if you were to use this for gaming, it’s pretty darn good for multiplayer, and also really good for single player games.",77,5.0,2021,05,May,26

Great price,2,"I’ve had this headset for over a year now. It’s a good headset to use if you’re on a budget and just need basic use. The sound is pretty good, the only complaint I have is the mic sound quality. I was told by my friends that I sound muffled, but that is to be expected for a headset for this price. I still highly recommend buying this though, because it definitely is a great headset for its cheap affordable price. It’s easy to use and for me has been quite durable. Normally cheap headsets will start to degrade and tear from excessive use, but I found that this material has held up good for my uses. I have big ears and I found it to be pretty comfortable for my ears over a long period of use. Definitely recommend buying it now, as the price has dropped. When I first bought it, the price was around $25.",158,5.0,2021,05,May,25

My son is happy because he has a new headset to use with his gaming console.  However, I am out of pocket and have to spend more money to look for something that is compatible with a laptop.

The first pair had perfect sound quality and I loved the threaded wire as it made it less likely to knot, tangle, and wrap up again. Getting my second pair as the first pair wore down from over a full year of daily use, I do notice they made some changes. And the changes are excellent! The headphones fit nicer on my head and cancel more noise for better sound quality. It's nice to see quality changes get better over time.These headphones are especially great for those who play videogames. Great quality, comfortable, and looks great!",121,2.0,2021,05,May,19
Pretty good...,2,Good,1,4.0,2021,05,May,19
Bang for your buck,4,"Horrendous mic quality, constantly getting muted by teammates for it. Don’t spend the money on a wish.com quality headset",19,4.0,2021,05,May,19
It also lights up and a great headset,8,I use these headphones for my at home job as well as gaming and I often get complaints from my customers that they cannot hear me. I actually bought these headphones to replace a different pair of gaming headphones and I do have less complaints about my audio with these headphones but even just one complaint is still pretty bad.,60,5.0,2021,05,May,19
Great!,1,The sound quality is decent but the mic doesn’t work that well so if you need a mic to play with friends I wouldn’t recommend this.,26,5.0,2021,05,May,19
Would recommend!,2,"I've had these for about 2 years now and they still feel and sound great. Good choice for a standard, cheap headset or general PC usePros:- plastic is light and flexible. good for long play sessions.- cord is strong even after a few mishaps with my chair wheel- good sound quality. (I'm not an expert in sound mixing but i know what bad headphones sound like)- I rarely use the mic but it's functional and the mute switch still holds solidCons:- cord may be strong but it's prone to bending in weird ways. it may just be how i rapped my cord around the back of my neck but it caused part of it to form a rigid curve- the volume control is a little loose and will sometimes rise or lower if brushed against- noise cancelling is effective but not perfect; about what you expect. though depending on what you want this could be a positive- LED is barely a feature. it either takes up a usb port or the plug dangles from the back of your PC or the bottom of your controller",185,5.0,2021,05,May,19

Do not buy this for Xbox!!!!,6,"Great product, great price, overall satisfied! Would buy again and recommend to others!",13,2.0,2021,05,May,17
Perfect for gaming,3,The overall audio is really good but you can only hear from one side of the headphone and every often you can hear a static noise that is coming from the headset and The only way you can fix it is by unplugging and plugging back in and I know that’s not exactly you know annoying or an inconvenience but it is kind of annoying to you know having to unplug and plug back in,75,5.0,2021,05,May,17
family,1,"Tried to use this on a work call with my laptop and on xbox for game session. No one could hear me, the mic has very low sound pick up. Also the microphone sits differently to the picture, the picture makes it look close to the face/mouth but when pulled into position you can not get it close to the side of your face let alone level with your mouth for sound.The positive is that the lights are nice and they are comfortable on the ears.",86,5.0,2021,05,May,16

You can hear other’s good but I guess the mic is crap because the other people can’t her you talking even with the mic turned all the way up. Gave them to a child for Christmas and with in 3 months they aren’t working and he’s complained the whole time that the other kids can’t hear him.

"Great sound and mic! Looks expensive, but isn't!",8,It does not light up,5,5.0,2021,05,May,13
very good for gaming,4,"I've had this headset for a couple weeks.  So far, I'd say it is working very well.  Sound quality is good.  There is no active noise cancellation, but I don't feel that it would be necessary.  I can hear everything clearly without turning the volume up too high.  The higher you go, the more distortion you will hear as expected.  At first, I wasn't getting the microphone to work.  I unplugged the splitter from the single 3.5mm aux plug and re-connected it.  After plugging both audio cables from the splitter in again, everything worked as intended.  For those who aren't familiar, make sure the pink connector goes into the microphone port and green goes into the headset port.  This review is based on using the headset on a pc.  I have not tried using it with anything else at this time.  Also, there is a toggle switch next to the volume dial on the headset.  Make sure it is switched on (microphone symbol without line through it) if you plan to use the microphone.  Overall, I would recommend this headset.  It is priced very reasonably and it meets my needs.",190,5.0,2021,05,May,13
Great headphones for the price!,5,Not bad for the price.,5,5.0,2021,05,May,13
excellent,1,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the headphones for the price that they were. They are very comfortable to wear, and the mic is placed at a good distance from your mouth so people can only hear you when you want them too. I'm not experienced enough in the gaming equipment world but the quality of sound is great for me too!  If you want a cheap, reliable headset, I would highly recommend this one!",77,5.0,2021,05,May,13

Nice headset,2," This is a great gaming headset for Xbox. It has very good noise cancellation. My son really liked the blue lights but just a heads up - as someother reviewers have stated, the blue light only turns on when connected to a laptop or PC because you need to insert the USB cable in.My son doesn’t seem to mind it while playing Xbox though. He loves his new gaming headset! Great customer support from Bengoo too.",76,5.0,2021,05,May,13
Little heavy but clear sound and good quality product,9,"I haven't played games in years. I was recently gifted a Google Stadia and have started to casually play games with friends online.

Seller reached out,3,"I purchased two of these- one was refurbished and the other brand new. Surprisingly, the refurbished one works flawlessly, but the new one has many issues.

Good product and CHEAP.,4,I gave it a four star rating only because we realized that to use it for the Xbox one you can’t have the lights on at the same time for talking because the plugs for the lights has to be plugged into the Xbox it’s self but to talk the plug has to be plugged into the controller and the cords split off of each other so it’s not long enough. Other than that it works great and my son loves it,82,5.0,2021,05,May,12

Not bad,2,"The reason why I bought this was because I wanted better sound quality when I played video games.The reason why it is good is because it has good sound quality. For example, you can hear a lot of things with the headphones like where things are. Say you can hear someone you know if they are on the right or the left.The next reason is that it has a long cord so it doesn't make you lean forward when you play a game. For example, when you use normal headphones the cord is so short that when you plug  it in you have to lean forward to make sure that you can use it. These headphones you have no problem.The last reason is that it has the ability to connect to all devices. For example, you can connect it to things like a pc ps4 xbox ect. After using them I think that I would recommend them.",157,4.0,2021,05,May,10

Came in a day sooner than expected. They have great sound, came in at full volume and I had to lower the volume since it was so loud. I don't use the mic because I have a standalone mic, so I can't say how that works. My only complaint is the ear cushions aren't as comfortable as I hoped, they're kind of stiff.",98,5.0,2021,05,May,10

Great buy,2,"The reason why I got it is so I could do a party chat on the PS4 since my EarPods didn't work at all with my PS4. I tried it out and the audio works brilliantly and it's easy to adjust and turn on and off the mic. Although I did want it also for the light up function that it is and it was a bit disappointing when I needed to also plug it into a USB port so the lights would turn on. I'm just glad that I have a converter for my MacBook so I could plug it to my laptop as well as my controller. Although I wish I could make it longer, the spot where the two plug ins are so I won't have to sit so close to my laptop just to get both features that I want.",144,5.0,2021,05,May,10

It's a comfortable design and the cord is super long. It has a button on the the cord that allows you to mute the headset. It also has a volume control that gives a better control instead of having to play with the sound setting on the computer or on the TV if you are using it for console gaming.

its good.,2,"This headset is Great for gaming and basically anything else! It has a volume switch so you don't have to bend over your keyboard to press the volume button, and you can change the volume as well! My favorite part is the cushion at the top, my last pair of headphones were very uncomfortable, but now my head feels a lot better because of it. And it also has a headset microphone so you can chat with friends, the only downside is that the cord is very long and it's  so it can sometimes get in the way if you're playing a game, but all in all these are great high quality headphones for a very cheap price.*This was written by my 10 year old son who plays games on PC and other platforms.

I would recommend these for kids for that alone. Otherwise, they aren't bad as a replacement for 20 bucks. They also can use a USB or a single port (the wire is split) and even comes with a splitter for the single port (a total of 3 different ways to hook it up).  It is made of cheap plastic so it might be for everyone but it's not a bad option if you need a headset.",99,5.0,2021,04,April,26

You have a wire with the aux jack that connects to your controller and then you have a USB wire that you need to plug into the console if you want the headphones to light up.

If the weight of the headset doesn't bother you, then definitely this is a solid product. But I've never felt so much weight from a headset. It's kind of concerning that this is also a gaming headset because the amount of time people will use it for gaming, it can probably cause pain to your neck/back in the long run.

Being able to hear,4,"I'm really enjoying this headset. I am saddened by the fact that for one of the headsets, the mic doesn't work. Yes, we've tried all the troubleshooting options. But they're are working very well for me for my ps5 gaming purposes. Literally the only comment I have is more of a minor annoyance: I don't care for the distance of the split for the jack and the USB. While playing with a controller, the USB is useless but it can get in the way at times, even when I wrap it up with the velcro strap it comes with. It'd be nice if I could slide the plastic point where it splits to give myself more slack since I can't use the USB anyways. But it's really not that hard to move past. Just annoying. I'm overall very happy with my purchase.",142,5.0,2021,04,April,22

Worth the money.,3,"So I have 7 kids and they all homeschool, I don't have an office but do both work and school myself at home with the kids all around me.  These seem to get everything done I was hoping for.  They are quiet enough inside to ignore the kids when needed. The mic does cancel out the computer games being played right next to me while on Skype call.  On Amazon, it did specifically say it did not come with a 3.5mm audio adapter for slitting the mic and headphone jack locations, but mine did show up with a set so the ones I ordered in addition are no longer needed.  I find them comfortable. They were an easy plug-and-play type set up. The only thing that I can't specifically comment on one way or another is longevity as I have only gotten them today.",144,5.0,2021,04,April,22

However they work fine for my Xbox One with no need to buy anything extra. I'm not sure exactly what I'm missing for them to not be working.

Great headphones. Good sound well made but the foam headset oeels,11,"I bought this after my $32 Xiberia headset broke, and was blown away by how much of a downgrade it was. I might actually tape up the Xiberia to use it instead of this. The sound quality on these is bad, there are weird whining noises in the earpiece whenever people talk to me, it has a separate USB port which I thought would be nice but its only purpose is to turn on the lights. No joke, this is a waste of $20. Spend a bit more and get a pair of Xiberias here instead. https://www.amazon.com/Jeecoo-Headset-Surround-Headphones-Cancelling/dp/B07TC8J6HK/ref=sr_1_4?crid=29I5IJYBRIEL3&dchild=1&keywords=usb+headset&qid=1619124959&s=electronics&sprefix=usb+headset%2Celectronics%2C256&sr=1-4",97,4.0,2021,04,April,18

nice headphones,2,This is a very nice headset for ps4. The only complaint I have is that it only lights up when the USB is plugged in which can be difficult when you already have stuff for gaming plugged in.

Great price,2,"I had ordered these to replace my headset that went out and I will admit, these worked AMAZINGLY!

Great,1,"I loved this little headset for the 3 years I've used it. Long hours every day for 3 years, and the sound quality never diminished at all.

Great quality,2,"Pros:Games sound nice and loud without any distortion.Cheap but good.Great first time gaming head set.Comfortable even when playing for four or more hours.Cons:No noise canceling.Large and somewhat cumbersome.Cord is long and thick so if you have it plugged into a PS4 or PS5 controller it is annoyingly in the way.USB connector for the LED lights is also annoying. (Not even sure what the lights are for anyway. You can't see them when wearing the headset......unless you play in front of a mirrior).Good, cheap entry level headset. My first one, it is comfortable and lightweight but feels reasonably sturdy. Sound is nice an loud. Crisp but not a lot of bass. Would definitely recommend for the casual gamer, like myself. Microphone is omnidirectional and pretty sensitive so keep that in mind if you are playing in a noisy environment.",138,5.0,2021,04,April,07

Decent for it's price,4,"I'm not much of a gamer but I got these for work conference calls because my computer's mic is terrible. The first thing I noticed is that they felt like they were made with cheap plastic. The ear cushions are super stiff and they don't seem to get worn-in after using them. Even though I don't game too much, I still have some multi-hour sessions on GTA 5 at night and use these so I dont wake up my house. The sound is good but the ear cushions really start hurting my ears after prolonged usage. If you're looking for comfort, go elsewhere.The overall sound is good, not great. Absolutely no noise cancelling functions.",114,3.0,2021,04,April,01

I wanted to be able to chat with friends online while gaming, and even with my output volume all the way up, and friends turning me all the way up in their settings, they could barely hear me.

This are great headphones for online school.,7,"The price on this headset was unbeatable.  I have had them for 4-5 months and I can’t believe how good they sound especially for the price point.  And they have held up with nothing breaking.  They are very comfortable and I have had several 4-5 hour gaming sessions with no complaints.  They don’t sound as good as the Sony Bluetooth set I have but they were 5x more expensive so I didn’t expect them to.  The LED lights are cool but fortunately you can not use them by not plugging in the USB connection.

Great value!! You won’t be disappointed,6,I used these headphones for gaming and they were by far the best headphones especially considering it’s price. The earmuffs fit nicely on my ears and are very comfortable. What would make these headphones even better would be the ability to change how high/low you want the sound of the game versus the sound of voice chat and vice versa like PS4 headphones.,63,5.0,2021,03,March,28

Decent quality,2,"I am very pleased with the quality on the device, it does not feel cheap in any way, for the price is a lot better working that other more expensive ones, is not too heavy which make it very comfortable to wear for hours in online tournaments, the cushions seat perfectly around the ears isolating from external noise and making very clear the sound on the games.Even when these are considered entry level, It is a pleasure to use them while playing all my games.I also use them to play music and the surround sound is amazing, i can hear every instrument with absolute clarity.I guess i will be updating this review as the time goes by, but for now, i will say that i am very pleased with all the characteristics and for the price, you cant go wrong.Frank",140,5.0,2021,03,March,28

Great sound!,2,"After 1 year of using these headphones I am finally going to get rid of these. That's not to say it's bad it's just not for me. After a year, these still work great (even though they've fallen too many times to count). The audio is fine, but everything else is lacking. Straight out of the box the microphone levels were too low so I had to already go to my sound panel and microphone boost it to +10 dB. I could hear my voice nice and clear but it picked up just about everything else in my room, not to mention that it also picked up the sounds from the speakers inside the earcups. Made it impossible for me to play in a voice chat with friends because you would hear double the audio. Now onto the build quality of the headset, you get what you pay for. I am a pretty small person (kinda sad) and this headphone was still too small for me. It hurt my ears and the sides of my heads.For 30 dollars it's a decent set of headphones, but I recommend you buy something better, 3/5.",192,5.0,2021,03,March,28

Major pain to connect to pc for gaming...wow,8,"They work as intended, but sometimes they're weird. You do get what you pay for. The cord is obnoxiously long. The microphone only works if I have the switch perfectly in between the muted and not muted setting. Very odd. The headset covers your whole ear so it doesn't put pressure on them, which is nice. The headset itself is pretty big and clunky though. Definitely a good purchase if you're a casual gamer who just needs a cheap headset.

Nice headset,2,"(Original review: For this price, they're pretty good. They aren't 100% noise-cancelling, but around 90%. The speakers in the headphones are great. The microphone isn't great though. I was told I sounded like I was speaking into a plastic cup.)Within the first two weeks, the headphones no longer light up and the mic doesn't work. Customer service never returns any emails, even though I've sent 3 to them. Very disappointed! Will never buy from these people again.",77,5.0,2021,03,March,26

Decent for low budget,4,"For any headset as inexpensive as this headset, its actually a good one. It didn't have the best quality like what I normally get..but I didn't expect it to be very good. It felt as if it was kind of crushing my head from the cheap foam earpiece, and the foam piece that rests on top of your head didn't make it that much better. I could only wear it for about 30 minutes to an hour before hearing the pumping of my heart. The audio wasn't the best but it definitely isn't the worst audio. The mic is great and my friends said the only difference between my $200 mic and this one was, it was quieter. The adjustable function for the headset is what I disliked the most. Each time I adjust it. It always made a loud cracking sound from the adjusters, and each time I felt as if I was going to break or snap it in half because of how hard you have to pull to adjust the thing. In all, I wouldn't generally recommend this headset. I know it's a cheap option, but I have found lucid sound headsets or other main brand headsets as cheap as this one, that have a lot better quality than this one. I'm giving this one 4 stars mainly because its a cheap option for gaming, but I could easily give this 2 since I can find better options that are as cheap as this headset. If you are looking for a good headset that will last a long time. I recommend corsair voids, or just any ""more expensive headsets"" aiming around $75-$150",275,4.0,2021,03,March,26

I just wanted a headset so that I can have awesome sound and mute myself when I wanted to. These are honestly great. I haven't had the chance to use them for gaming yet (college student life) but Jesus they are amazing for rocking out so far and the light up feature makes them look awesome!

Amazing!,1,It is OK for a beginner headset or for your kid who plays and he’s probably gonna break it after a couple weeks but other than that you pretty much get what you pay for it’s made out of cheap material and feels like it anyone who plays a lot It’s probably not what your looking for.,57,5.0,2021,03,March,26

"Great Product, came fast and sounds great!",7,"Looking at the amazing price and the sheer number of reviews, i thought these would be good, but I was disappointed. They look really really cheap, and feel that way too. Mine had some dried glue or subtance from the factory on them. They were ok in comfort, but I had to draw the line with sound quality. If you've ever owned a pair of Turtle Beach headphones, these sound so muffled. There was no range to the sound at all. Just mids and lows. It made it hard to be competitive in warzone because you couldn't really make out some crucial distinct sounds like the direction of footsteps or gunfire. I probably should have known better, given the price. According to other reviews, this headset is pretty decent, but i guess they just aren't for me.",137,5.0,2021,03,March,25

Plugs are covered with a plastic cover for protection, and it comes with the adapter for PC use. I love the pink color, very nice and pastel. The lights add a nice flare to it as well, although they only stay one color and don't change. Padding is comfortable and does not make the headphones feel so heavy and tight on my head. The material is like a hard plastic for the overall headphone and controls. I like it a lot. I recommend getting these headphones.",111,4.0,2021,03,March,25

Great headphones just sometimes make the controller do weird stuff while playing,12,"I wasn't expecting much heading into my time with Bengoo's G9000 gaming headset. After all, it costs around $25 and is made by a relatively unproven brand. Surely it can't beat the likes of Astro, SteelSeries, Turtle Beach and the like, right?Nope, it can't. But what you do get is a surprisingly solid pair of cans for your gaming needs. The Bengoo G9000 is an over-ear headset featuring inline volume control, a flip boom microphone, and non-customizable blue LED lights. It looks the part it plays for those who like something a bit flashy looking, though I personally was never a fan of the sharp, pointy edges that mainstream gaming accessories tend to sport.",114,5.0,2021,03,March,25

"Great Product, Great Quality",4,itr is a very good headset mic is good sound quality is good and is very comfortable,17,5.0,2021,03,March,23
Why spend more money!!!?,4,This is still 5 stars because description is correct and perfect for price nothing else will beat it!! best for laptop pc gaming but I bought it for ps4 console. So the lighting feature won’t work because the usb cable is not long enough to reach the console while also having the auxiliary plugged into your ps4 remote. What you can do is have a phone charging battery pack with you to have it power up the led lights lol. That’s what I did,84,4.0,2021,03,March,23
Good product at a good price,6,"What a great headset! They work just as intended and they’re stylish. No complaints, delivered on time with no hassle. 10/10 would buy again. Amazon is a great company!",29,5.0,2021,03,March,23

Trash,1,So far so good!  My son is super excited to have an official gaming headset.,15,2.0,2021,03,March,23
Good for what it cost,5,I liked that the sound quality was great for the price. It’s comfortable although haven’t worn for more than an hour but I’m sure it will still be comfortable. Only drawback is the version I got had the usb and six cable too short to separate. I can only plug in one or the other. Usb is used to light up and six is for the sound. So either I get lights or sound but not together unless I hookup to a power bank.,84,5.0,2021,03,March,23

Would recommend,2,I’ve had it for about a day now and it’s already been a big use in my life. I’ve so far used them to play games with my close friends and it’s great we can here each other clearly.

It is great,3,Great gaming headset for my son!,6,5.0,2021,03,March,23
Surprisingly Good for the Price,5,Junk! My son barely used these for a month... maybe a total of 24 hours and the sound stopped working. The sound stopped working on one side and then 2 days later both sides gave out all together. Don’t waste your money.,42,5.0,2021,03,March,23

Great headset at a super price.,6,Comfortable headset!,2,5.0,2021,03,March,22
So Far So Good.,4,"I used this headset with my xbox one. Got it for $20 on a black friday deal, which was nice, though I guess I got what I paid for. Was lured in a little by the LED lights, and I was a bit disappointed to find out I wouldn't be able to use them, since they only activate when connected to a PC.The sound quality was as expected for a $50 headset: wasn't amazing, but was by no means terrible. The ear cuffs are definitely noise-blocking and they're surprisingly comfortable to wear, even if you wear glasses. Since I wear glasses, most headsets start to hurt my ears after a while; but I experienced no pain with this one.The mic was okay; never really had any problems with it. I did have slight problems with the volume control though; sometimes, it would catch/rub on my clothing and randomly turn the volume up or down. Wasn't that big of an issue, though, since it rarely happened.I'd say my only valid complaint was the letdown of only having it for 4 months before it died. I was really excited about this headset. The whole reason I bought it was so I could get something that would last me a bit longer than a cheap, $20-$30 headset would; but it barely lasted me four months. What's even worse is that I still currently have a $20 headset that has lasted longer! And I'm someone who takes care of all things electronic and electronic-related, so this was the result of the actual headset failing. Might have given it 4 or 5 stars had it been of use for just a little while longer.",279,3.0,2021,03,March,22
"good surround sound , super light",6,I wasn't expecting much from the gaming headset I got from Bengoo but they far exceeded my expectations. I like them better than previous gaming headphones purchased off amazon. Sound great and look great as well!,36,5.0,2021,03,March,22

Very comfortable and affordable,4,Headset works great. Ear muffs are deep and large enough that they cover my ears fully with no pressure points.

Nice,1,I had my last one for 5 years. I ended up breaking it.. but I got another one and honestly for the price and how long it lasted as well as quality. It’s definitely a worth while buy.

Great headphones,2, After reading a few reviews I decided to give this headset a try. When I put it on I immediately felt the comfort the were talking about. The quality that you get for the price makes it very much worthy. It isn't a name brand headset you find at game stop but it is comparable(Maybe better). 5 stars hands down.,60,5.0,2021,03,March,22
Amazing product,2,"Overall a good set of headphones. They are slightly tight for the wearer, so he avoids them when he has a headache.",22,5.0,2021,03,March,22

Buy them!,2,"The headset is a pretty good price, very easy to start using, and has a sleek cool design to match. It cancels out noise pretty good as well, for example, it blocks out the noise caused by a fan I have in my room. My only actual complaint is that it is kind of small ,like it covers my ears completely but only barely does it do that. If you are around 20 or younger it should be fine, but you may want a bigger size otherwise.",87,5.0,2021,03,March,21

Rip off,2,"Super good quality microphone and headphones! I bought these to start streaming and the microphone only picks up my voice so I don't need to worry about background noise being picked up.

Durable,1,"These work well and the sound quality is good. They completely cover the ears and seem to be comfortable enough. They rest on the pad on top of the head and I would probably get tired of that with extended wear, but overall they are a good product at a good price.",52,5.0,2021,03,March,20
Gaming,1,Honestly I love them and it’s not even for me!...they are just a couple of dollars more than usual headphones but buy these instead! The sound is so clear and the noise cancellation is good. I bought these for my fiancé for gaming and he loves them!,47,5.0,2021,03,March,20

It works good.,3,Got them for use with my children who seem to destroy headphones by looking at them. Integrated mic works well for class and they are comfortable enough to be worn or the whole school day. The cord is long enough it's not getting yanked out all the time and it feels more durable than some of the thin wires on most inexpensive sets.,63,4.0,2021,03,March,20
Worked Great the first day....After that...Not so much.,8,"Can barely hear myself talk with them on, huge plus!",10,1.0,2021,03,March,20
Good,1,"These headsets (I bought 2 pairs) didn’t even work right the first time either were used... Clicking the sound button does nothing to shut the sound off, nor does switching the mic part up. There are just time while playing CoD where everyone DOES NOT need to hear my background noise... One of the pairs got stuck all the way extended and I can’t get it to go back in. All in all I’d say invest a bit more money and get a nicer pair...",85,3.0,2021,03,March,20

DISAPPOINTING! DOES NOT WORK,4,"Overall the headphones felt like a plastic toy you’d buy from the dollar store.. there is no noise cancellation because they don’t close around your ears completely. Not sure if this is a flaw in design or I got a pair that was made incorrectly, but either way save your money. For this price you can get something 100% better and not have to go through the hassle of returning it or the disappointment of thinking you’re getting something good for the price.",83,1.0,2021,03,March,12

However, i'm not sure if it's just me because I have a smaller head but they could look a little funny/big when wearing. Also, when playing, sometimes the people that i'm talking to don't really hear me well at times or can sound low/soft. Another thing I noticed is that when it's plugged into my controller, it sometimes make a loud static noise often. I'm not sure if it's because of the cord not being put right by myself or because of the cord itself.",105,5.0,2021,03,March,10

Review,1,"While it isn't on par with some of the more expensive headsets out there, for the value that it was give ($25 discounted), this is a good pair of headsets that helps for those that want to get into the video gaming craze.  This pair of headphones is big, so size should be covered for those with big, round heads.  While the game audio is a bit filled with bass at times, the quality outside of that is really good, and the size comes to an advantage again as it helps with noise cancellation both in mic and in speakers.  If you can get the same deal I did, I recommend it for a first-timer.",115,5.0,2021,03,March,10

Wired game headset,3,"I am a 39 year old woman with a small head. I have a hard time even finding retail hats that fit me. So I have a horrible time finding any kind of headphones that fit and/or are not painful. I only just got these, and on the smallest setting they mostly fit. I could honestly have them just a little smaller and be perfect but at least these are not squeezing my head like a vice as so many do. The ear pieces go all the way around my ears so they are also not squeezing my ears which is painful. I think they will be ok for long periods of use because they do not hurt. The sound quality seems fine, I'm hearing surround sound in my game as I type this. My voice comes out clear as does those I am chatting with. It's easy to mute myself as well and change the volume right from the headset. Over all I think these are really good quality! And a great price!The lights are pretty, although I doubt I will bother using them since I do not stream, and I only have two usb ports on my laptop anyway.",201,5.0,2021,03,March,06

"noise cancelling, good sound",4,it's very small.I really enjoyed the sleek design of it.But I think I'll have to give this to my kid.Yeah the padding is soft but very firm. Maybe my ears are too big? Cause it hurts to wear after a long period of time (max 3 hours)The microphone isn't great for what I wanted. I'm just too soft spoken of a person for this to work for me. Probably cause the mic is stiff and I can't get it any closer to my face. This purchase was a learning experience for me.,92,5.0,2021,03,March,05

Good bang for your buck,5,"Yeah, I know it's relatively cheap, but I didn't expect it to be that feeble.  The sound and recording quality is pretty bad.  I might as well just talk through a laptop's open mic.  Even with software noise suppression, the listening quality is pretty awful - worthless for music listening.  The mic itself is has poor response and acquisition.Then there's the USB which is only used to light the headset's LEDs up....really?Just shabby.",73,4.0,2021,03,March,05
Very good sound quality for the price!,7,Excellent detailed sound for video games. I’d say if you have an average vizio tv like me these headphones are a better quality experience. Very comfy.

Good quality,2,"I got these for my husband to use on Zoom while he works from home. He loves that he can’t hear our kids in the background and that he hears the people he’s talking with very clearly. He says he is made fun of daily, though, for the size of these headphones. His clients and colleagues constantly ask him if he’s become a gamer. They also crack jokes about him being an air traffic controller. I’ve offered to find him new headphones but he has declined. He takes the poking fun in stride and sees it as an icebreaker for his work sessions with his clients and colleagues. Overall, a great purchase. Wish I had gotten them for him a year ago when he first started working from home.",129,5.0,2021,03,March,04

Great Customer Service,3,"I picked this up so I could play the Xbox games via the mobile cloud app they provide. I Use this headset with my One S controller (via the 3.5 plug) to play the games I enjoy and talk on chat playing my online games.The headset fits wonderfully on my ears, not too tight, not loose. however, the ear coverings do not cancel out the noise as my other set does at home. Since this is an on-the-go-out in the public headset, I consider this a good thing as it lets me hear the close things happening around me and such.The headset is light enough to not feel like a giant weight on my head and feels sturdy enough to be durable for packing around in a messenger bag with my phone and controller. I have a thick vinal bag when traveling I keep these in to keep them from getting damaged or dirty.The sound is adequate on these (don't expect phenomenal quality sound like a high-priced headset.) The audio is clear and directional based on input from the games and such so I can know what direction my team and enemies are in.With that being said, the glow feature really isn't necessary but is very bright and attention-getting when plugged into a USB port (which just runs the LED lights in the earphones.) The bright blue would look really good on a live stream or lets play if you do that sort of thing.For the price I paid, I hope these hold up with the constant going and moving around that I do through the week.I'll come back when/if they finally break/fail to finish this review up and give input into the durability.",284,4.0,2021,03,March,04

Good Headset,2,"These ended up being a bit of a disappointment. We got them for our son for Christmas and we didn't realize that in order for the lights to work, the cord ALSO needs to be plugged into a USB port. He was using them mostly with a tablet so this was a bummer. Now, only three months later the cord has completely severed and they don't work at all. These have had extremely light wear and tear, never leaving the house and only used for a couple hours a day.",90,4.0,2021,03,March,04

Love these headphones!!!,3,Honestly I feel really scammed. I plugged in these headphones into my PS4 and the sound quality WAS AWFUL.

Good,1,"The sound quality is great.  Mic tested fine.The quality of the materials seems a bit cheap though.  The cushion for the top of the head, was a bit minimal.  The ear muffs, were a bit small, and did not really provide sufficient room for your ears to be comfortably inside them.  My ears were aching/hurting within 2 hours of wearing the headphones.If you're a kid, these will probably work out great for you.  An adult?  pass 'em up.",78,5.0,2021,03,March,03

Using our 7-year-old to play his PlayStation 4, he can only get them to connect and work 25 percent of the time. We finally gave up and ordered another set from elsewhere locally. These headphones look good but are very unreliable and do not work all the time. The instructions are terrible and do not explain troubleshooting. I would stay away from them personally if I know the light on them is what attracted him to them in the first place. Sometimes things look better than they are, and this is one of them.",106,2.0,2021,03,March,03

Best headset in the world!,5,"It's a really nice headset, was a bit disappointed when I found that the usb was only for the lights and that you needed the splitter for the pc. Sadly, my laptop only has one jack, so I had to order another splitter just to use the new headset. I may have missed the description about all of that, so it could be my fault. It would have been nice though if the usb worked for both the lights and the headset.",82,5.0,2021,02,February,27
Great for price,3,Not made for PS4!!!!  First off you need to plug in the USB connection into a separate power source to get the lights to work. The sound jack that plugs in to your PS4 controller is split with the USB but both cords are very short.  So you have to choose to play with the lights off if you want to use it with the PS4 controller comfortably.  If thats the case then whats the point of owning it?  This is made more for laptops than PS4.  I dont recommend if you are thinking of buying it for the PS4.,100,4.0,2021,02,February,27

Crisp & Thumpin',3,"I bought the Charge 4 a year after I got the Charge 3. I loved the thumpin' bass on the charge3 and decided to pair it with another JBL product and decided to go with the upgrade so I got the Charge4. I set it up to the right and left of my work area. The whole set up sounded awesome with sound coming from both left and right speaker sources. As awesome as it was, though--it was NOT stereo - just two identical sounds coming from different sources- can't hear the sound engineer's instrumental separations during the recording (as with headphones) but like I said- produced some pretty good results for the price.",114,4.0,2022,11,November,07

GREAT SOUND AND BATTERY LIFE,5,Fast shipping. Great price. Awesome new high quality Bluetooth speaker at a great discount,14,5.0,2022,10,October,28
Disappointed,1,I purchased this item for my office so I could play some background music while I work. I work better with some low background music. The speaker is GREAT! The ONLY issue I’ve had is the speaker took forever to charge and after a while the battery wouldn’t charge all the way. I read online that if you have this problem you need to try using a different charging cord and charging plug. So I bought a new charging plug and cord. IT WORKED and now the speaker charges just fine. The charging cord that comes with the speaker may not be “strong” enough and you may need another charging cord and plug.,113,3.0,2022,10,October,28
SOUNDS AMAZING!,2,"My daughter has one of these and when I heard it I was blown away. Awesome sound with deep bass. It sounds best up to about 70% of volume, but even that is more than plenty of volume. The battery is awesome lasting several days and you can charge your phone or iPad without reducing a lot of battery life.",60,5.0,2022,10,October,28

I'M LOVIN 'IT!,3,"The main we reason we bought the JBL 4 to begin with was because it has the jack that you could use for an Ipod. (I know, old school).  My husband had spent years downloading all of his favorite songs on his Ipod and wanted to be able to listen to his playlist through a quality speaker. Once we received the speaker, we were super impressed with the sound quality. The bluetooth range is good too. We liked the quality so much that we have three of them! We keep one at home for pool parties and get togethers and we have two at our cabin.",106,5.0,2022,10,October,27

Great sound quality,3,"From the several bluetooth speakers I've owned for nearly 10 years, this significantly has the clearest and best quality sound of them all.

Longer battery life was a major factor for me.,9,"You cannot turn the speaker off without it, making a loud noise. They know it’s annoying. It’s meant to get you to install the app. If you install the app, giving up more of yourself to them in other words, they let you turn it off. I think it’s meant to be annoying because even if you turn the volume down to 0, and cannot hear anything else, it will still make a loud noise when turning off.They want you to not be able to turn it off quietly, for example, when you were listening to some thing in bed and forgot to turn it off and later on, want to turn it off quietly.Works fine otherwise.The one star is just cause I think it’s fair to penalize such behavior.",130,5.0,2022,10,October,11
"Aux out works great for low latency sound, when that's important.",11,"Sounds like a gigantic speaker.  My daughter had one of these from Amazon and I loved it on her coffee table to use with TV across the room, so I bought it and was impressed when listening to my Amazon downloaded music.

Great product,2,Own a charge 3 already. Based on reviews bought the charge 4. First thing I noticed is the 3 has better sound as in bass. The 4 is slightly larger and definitely goes louder. You can link two or more 4s together but 4 doesn’t link to 3. Dig this speaker,51,5.0,2022,10,October,04

The sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely. JBL speakers on Amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop! The quality is amazing and it’s so load for how small it is. This one doesn’t come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality I haven’t had any issues or scratches and I’ve just been throwing it in a tote bag! The charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast. If you’re debating between this one and a pricier one I would go with the Charge 4!",137,5.0,2022,09,September,25

The battery seems to be pretty good at 70% volume or less, but close to the top of the volume range, it really lacks in battery life.

So cool!,2,"Sound is great, very loud. I love it",8,5.0,2022,09,September,19
Easy to use never any problems connecting,7,Love the speaker. Sound quality is good. However we have had the hardest time. The speaker willPower off and then somehow power itself back on. It randomly turns on and you randomly connect to it. Tried customer service but couldn’t get anyone on the phone who could hear me clearly or understand English. I now have a speaker I have to keep plugged in and disconnect and turn off blue tooth or it just automatically connects.,76,5.0,2022,09,September,19
Volume button turns it off. It's a dud and others have had this same issue.,15,Battery life is pretty good sounds OK,7,1.0,2022,09,September,19
It's fine... It's connectivity range is pretty nice.,8,"I have a weird situation with my speaker, everything works fine except that it doesnt allow me to turn it Off, whenever you try to turn it off, it goes off for some 4-5 sec and turns ON by itself. I have try several troubleshooting steps and still the same.",50,3.0,2022,09,September,16

great speaker,2,"I absolutely love this little speaker, for its size it is truly incredible and it has been very durable! The ability to connect multiple together is very useful.

Soeaker,1,"It's an adequate speaker for this price point.  I'll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine.  I do not feel like I wasted money, but if/when I buy another of these types of speakers it won't be a JBL.  It's been at least 3 years since I've bought one of these BT speakers and my last speaker was just as loud/clear, cost less, had features that just worked, and even came with a lanyard for easy carry.  This thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands.-Volume and Sound Quality:  It's loud in a room with no ambient noise. My music is mostly 90's rock like Metallica, Pantera, White Zombie.  I like loud music and for my private office it's perfect.I'll mostly listen at 1/3 volume so I can think, but it's nice to jam out sometimes. At middle volume level the sound is the best (lows vs highs) above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise.  You could use this in an environment with ambient noise, like a warehouse or kitchen, but you would need to stay around 5' if you want to really enjoy what is playing.  After 10' it's probably going to sound more like noise than music.-Phone Connectivity is simple for music just push a top button, but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker I had in the price point.  There are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this, the manual certainly is no help, but it's not what I needed it for.  I just liked it as a nice side feature I used sometimes with my last speaker like this.-Battery Life is fine, I haven't done complete testing on this.  It does have a pretty significant battery in it for the ""charge your device"" option, but 20 hrs?  Maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music.  I won't need it for longer than 4hrs most of the time, so I doubt this will come up as an issue for me.-There's an app but it does very little for this speaker.  Most ""useful"" feature is a digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker.  Thankfully for it's main function of BT Connecting and playing music it's pretty basic and simple.  If you go the route of multiple speakers, reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work.  It is not intuitive, it's a series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with, and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews.",445,5.0,2022,09,September,14
Sound,1,"As a previous Jambox owner, I purchased this because I was told there would be good bass, sound clarity, and volume; I love playing loud music when showering. Unfortunately, this wasn’t it. I wish I could return because it’s not given what was sold.",44,3.0,2022,09,September,13

Works great,2,The speed at which it turns on and connects to your device is unmatched for me. The battery life is just amazing. I have it playing for 7 hours sometimes and it doesn’t even lose half the battery. I’ve taken it out on the water and it’s gotten wet with no issues. Just an absolutely amazing speaker.,57,5.0,2022,09,September,12

Good to use in dirty/dusty environments,6,Well I thought the product was great but I expected it to be louder which it wasn’t. Don’t get me wrong it is pretty loud but I just expected it to be more. To the reviews I’ve seen they made it seem like you would physically have to lower the volume or else you would go deaf but I don’t know.,61,5.0,2022,09,September,11

Awesome,1,"This is my second JBL speaker and the first one lasted me almost 5 years with no issues. So far this one works pretty well, and has good sound quality. Every once and a while the BT won’t automatically connect and I have to manually do it. The battery life is good. I usually listen to music as I get ready for work in the mornings and it lasts three weeks doing that before it needs a recharge.",78,5.0,2022,09,September,10
SIL loves it so that's good.,6,"I had this model on hold for a long while as I searched for the best all around speaker for my 14 year old sons bday. This thing is awesome! Sound is crisp and clear. And no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level. From Rap to Reggaton this speaker is awesome. JBL is an old U.S. brand and still putting out a great product. Even the color design is solid without peeling. I have two more on my list for Christmas for my other son and my husband. I definitely recommend buying the case. This does come with a USB ""C"" type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall. This is also a charger and has an On/Off button. Volume is controlled by Bluetooth on smart phone. Instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation. Make sure you look all yhrough the box so you don't accidentally throw the cord out.",156,5.0,2022,09,September,09
Actually worth the money..,4,"I bought the JBL Xtreme 3 speaker a few years back and loved it. This one was purchased as a gift for someone who spends a lot of time outdoors and wood working, so the cover for the charging port was necessary. So far, there have been 0 issues and sound quality is great - to be expected from JBL speakers",61,5.0,2022,09,September,09

The best wireless speaker purchase!,5,Wish it was bigger. I’m using it out by the horseshoe pit and in my room at night. It sounds great but it’s not enough sound to rock the block.

Music,1,"Not into the latest commercial fads but I am very impressed by these radios. The size and sound is about the same as a high end radio. This streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with ""bad reception"". Truly a revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience. Living in NYC I am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from Massachusetts along with one in my area that has a weak signal. I love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life. Have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference. I own a much higher end, powerful, stereo system for a more engaging musical experience. A well designed, water resistant, portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors. Have fun finding some of your out of area (online) radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technology...",165,5.0,2022,09,September,08

Arrived DOA,2,"I spend a lot of time working with music, esp. mixing, mastering, composing.I wanted a speaker I could enjoy while I was at the skatepark w my friends, something that could get loud and sound really good. I heard JBL was pretty popular and had a good reputation, but I was dissappointed with the Charge 4.In terms of build quality, it's a nice speaker. It feels sturdy and looks good. But as soon as I turned on a song, I was shocked by the quality of audio. The mid frequencies were boosted and they made audio sound muddy and unpleasant. For a $114 speaker, that was a real letdown.I checked out their app hoping for some sort of software update/tune up, but it's very bare bones and didn't have anything to help. I also checked if ""bass mode"" was on, and it was from the start.I went into my phone's EQ settings and manually changed the spectrum to my liking. If you own this speaker, I recommend you (moderately) raise the lows, duck the mids, and raise the highs. That made the speaker a lot more pleasant. But as soon as I did that, it took a loss on its max volume.The skatepark I go to is pretty small, but has metal ramps that get loud. This speaker wasn't enough for the park. It's definitely okay if you're at a small picnic, in an apartment, etc. But it doesn't get as loud as I was hoping.Overall, this speaker isn't worth the price. For an allegedly reputable brand it's absurd the sound quality doesn't come good from the start. It felt like I paid $115 for a JBL logo.What I think I'll do is buy from a cheaper brand and do the EQ tuning myself.Hope this helps, have a good week!",300,1.0,2022,08,August,30

Great and portable,3,"I've been a JBL guy since the 70's (shows my age I guess).  My experience with JBL has been great.  They make great speakers that provide the best sound for the buck in my opinion.  That said, there are so many choices today for speakers, many more than 50 years ago it can be difficult to choose. If you are looking for a great little bluetooth speaker with a great sound you can do no better than this JBL Charge 4.  It pairs very easily and quickly with whatever source, iphone or ipad in my case.  The sound is terrific for such a small package.  Other blutetooth speakers I have tried can't compare in sound or reliability.  I use it on my patio, and the range and volume for the area are perfect.  Battery seems to be real plus, I am still running on the first charge.  It's  also rated very well by Consumer Reports.  You can't go wrong with the JBL Charge 4.",164,5.0,2022,08,August,27

Love this speaker,3,"These charge 4 speakers are great. I bought 2 more to go with a couple I already had. They easily sync up with each other which makes it easy to fill larger spaces with great sound. If you put them in corners, they sound even fuller. I wish that the Charge 4 still had to ability to take phone calls, but I guess that isn’t that big of a deal. The batteries have listed all day and more. It is also handy that I can charge my phone from them as well.",92,5.0,2022,08,August,25
JBL charge 4,3,"Unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun, I used it for work. As a FedEx Express courier, not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls, arm rests, cruise control, or insulation from the elements, we don't have speakers! Imagine hours on the road in a loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress!So one night I decided, no more of that. This speaker fit right into the passengers ""seat"", and I would strap the seatbelt just incase (the trucks had world class terrible suspension, the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying).With that, at full volume in the truck that battery might last around 4 or 5 hours. But man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise, tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body, everything. It made my driving experience so much better. That being said, I would only need full volume on the highway (did you know Express trucks are governed to 65mph? Well, assuming our trucks could even easily reach that. At least in my station they all had check engine lights and I once timed that it took 27 seconds to go from 40mph to 65mph. Fun!) and when I was driving from 30-50mph having the speaker at ~70% was fine. At that rate I could make it last about 8 hours before needing a recharge.I thank JBL for creating such a great speaker and frankly I am sure their other products have that battery capacity I needed, but I got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack. For the situation I was in, it was a total game changer. I went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs. On the off-chance another courier reads this, making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery. I will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind.Luckily I do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use, but when I needed it, my life was much better for it. It sat next to an open door in an Isuzu Reach and never moved a centimeter, providing me with amazing sound all the while. I know now anything and everything I might throw at it will never take it down. If battery life is your concern, it is valid. If you want the best sound for the size of the speaker, this is hard to beat, and it has my ""doing deliveries in a tin can with an open door on a road at 45mph still sounding good"" seal of approval!",481,5.0,2022,08,August,24

Best speaker,2,"Sounds good but so many of these companies spend more budget on marketing spinners rather than solid honest technology.The talk of 2 of these producing stereo via the app may or may not be true.  I don't mind buying two but this intentional vagueness really sucks.We need more engineers and less marketers in this world.  Engineers with budgets build good stuff, marketers dance and hide stuff.No mic for phone calls.  :(I will update when abd if I find the time to unravel the intentional fog.  Others seem to have plenty of comments which may have good info.Happy with the mono sound so far, will keep, for now.",107,5.0,2022,08,August,07

It came partially charged, so I fully charged it before I used it.  I've had it for 3 weeks now, and haven't had to charge it yet!  The sound quality is incredible.  The bass is window shaking!

Turned it on toward the end of July while making dinner and it played for a few seconds then made a crackling noise and stopped playing. Hitting the play/pause button changes play/pause on my phone so I know it is connected but the speakers no longer work. No start up noise or shut down noise either. Never dropped, never got wet (even though it should be water proof), no abuse whatsoever. Just stopped working.Contacted customer support/warranty at JBL.

Not Much For Volume,4,"I bought the JBL Charge 4 in the summer of 2021.  12 months later and now it won't take a charge and shuts off within about a minute of turning it on while plugged in so it is completely unusable.  I'd assume that maybe I just bought a lemon but this has been a problem for all the JBL speakers I've bought.  I've owned the JBL earbuds, 3 JBL Clip 3 and 1 JBL Clip 4.  My JBL Clip 4 is the only one still working.  I'm going to try another brand because I'm tired of having to throw away speakers.",101,3.0,2022,07,July,23

Amazing battery life,3,"I was really excited about buying this speaker when I bought it because I’ve needed it for a while and I have a lot of use for it at the moment. However, it has been completely unreliable for me because it hasn’t been able to hold a charge. I think it has only been charged fully 2-3 times and now it never charges. The chargers used are brand new and the speaker is brand new. I did a factory reset more than once and it still won’t charge. The light blinks as if it is charging but it stays dead. I am so disappointed in this purchase and I hope the speaker can be replaced or exchanged.",117,5.0,2022,07,July,22

Took the charge 4 camping and set it up on a table at our camp trailer, Went  out to the camp fire, people asked me to turn it up some. When I explained it was at max volume they were surprised.

IS NOT WATERPROOF!!! mine got wet and now won't work at all! So bummed.,14,I originally bought the Sony more bass model and swapped it out for this JBL.  The JBL blew it away!  I’m a sound nut and for the size of these speaker they sound great.  But two and pair them and get great stereo sound.  Buy more than Two and pair them all and the stereo sound goes away.  So I ended up with just two of them and they are perfect.  Be sure to download the app to get the stereo sound setting.  Put one at each end of the pool and float away to great sound.,97,1.0,2022,07,July,17

Excellent,1,"I bought this to replace my 7 year old UE Boom. There was nothing wrong with my boom I just wanted an upgrade (So I thought). It was bigger than my UE Boom which was no big deal. But after I charged the JBL, and connected it I was very disappointed. The sound was very muffled. I hooked up my boom to a friend's phone and played the same sound on both....what a huge difference. In my opinion the UE Boom blows this JBL away.",85,5.0,2022,07,July,15
Awesome,1,I just recently bought two of them to be able to sync both speakers up together and it just makes the atmosphere of where you are just that much better. We just recently went out to the river and it was great to have them both connected since we could have one in the water and one with everyone else who was sitting down. the range on these are pretty decent as well and the battery can easily last all day but only if its not to max volume. great speakers though and I highly recommend.,96,5.0,2022,07,July,14

Not sensitive if it rolls around..... awesome!,7,"Weight just over two pounds.It’s not small enough that you can easilly put it in backpack .Buttons on device are easily accessible, sitting along the top of the deviceThe JBL Charge 4 offers slightly better power output than previous incarnations of the JBL Charge, with a rated power of 30 Watts RMS. Additionally, the device uses USB Type C for charging, can achieve a full charge in 4 hours, and offer 20 hours of playtime on a full charge.The JBL Charge 4 does feature JBL Connect Plus, so it can be wireless connected to more than 100 other JBL speakers that also have JBL Connect plus. It is worth noting that you can’t connect a JBL bluetooth speaker with JBL Connect to a JBL speaker with JBL Connect Plus.",129,5.0,2022,07,July,14
Great speakers and the battery 🔋 is awsome,8,"My life has changed! The sound quality of this battery is perfect for my space. Look we would all like perfect sound quality but the truth is so many factors determine sound quality, especially the recording itself. The JBL offers greatvpower. Turning down the volume usually helps with balancing the sound when played at higher levels. A winner!",58,5.0,2022,07,July,14

Great wifi speaker for the size and price!,8,"We bought 2 speakers to see which one we loved more. This was the note expensive one and after we tried then both, it wasn't even close. The quality of this speaker was awful compared to an off brand and it was half the cost. I wouldn't spend this type of money on it just for the name. There are better ones that are way better and cheaper.",68,5.0,2022,07,July,09
Impressive music booster with great sound quality,7,"This speaker seems very sturdy and durable.

5 hour battery life at very best.,7,"Got this speaker as a replacement for my original refurbished UE mega boom. I played that thing full volume on many occasions and after 3 years, although still sounding great, I feel the speaker might have ruptured a bit. Decided to try JBL and didn’t want to get the Charge 5 because of the price and a tacky huge JBL in the front. I think old speaker models offer great value, as they sound great and are cheaper. So far so good with this JBL, plenty loud of course, haven’t been doing full volume yet, because cautious due to my previous UE experience. Love that it sits on its side and love the color. We will see how it will hold up, but so far great, just as expected from JBL.",131,1.0,2022,07,July,09

Great sound,2,"The poor reviews are sometimes exaggerated, but the one I read is correct. My hearing isn't what it used to be. When I waa younger, I listened to some very wonderful equipment owned by me and some friends. My experience includes used to playing the saxophone and other musical instruments. I can recognize when music and/or voices are not in tune. I have even been ""accused of perfect pitch."" With that said, I can say that the Charge 4 is a horrible reproducer of sound. I own four JBL Flip 4 speakers and they do great job for their size.However, the Charge 4 has a sound profile of loud but muddied bass, hollow sounding mids and a really poor attempt at the highs. Tinny sounding like listening to an old AM only transistor radio. The Flip 4 is so much better, especially in pairs. Owning 4 allows me to have two fully charged until the other pair is discharged. I bought a single Charge 4 for an anticipated abusive future. I will be moving soon and as I put things in storage and load trucks and trailers, I wanted something that if damaged, it wouldn't break up my set of four.I thought the other reviewer may have received a ""lemon."" Ithought there is no possible way JBL would send out a mono speaker especially if the sound is not centered. The sound is ""centered"" about two inches from center. It is very annoying to me. Outside moving my belongings would be make this design flaw less noticible to imperceptible. I will return this and get something else.",267,5.0,2022,07,July,07

Best purchase,2,"I have had a Flip and a Clip before I bought the Charge. The sound quality is always great, battery life always seems to last longer than I need, and it always connects with no problem. The Clip is usually in my bathroom clipped to the shower rod, and the Charge is great for larger outdoor parties, or to have sound throughout the house. I find them esthetically pleasing and they blend in to my decor while giving great sound. This Charge was on sale and I got it for less than $100 - can’t beat that for the quality.",100,5.0,2022,07,July,05

Great,1,"I've had this unit for several years.  The sound is fine.  As some have described, the sound is definitely on the warm end of the spectrum and the highs are a bit lacking, but the performance is better than expected at this price point.  Anyway, no one should expect super high fidelity from a low cost portable speaker.We use ours to stream music when we are by the pool or in the hot tub, and to listen to audiobooks around the house.  It is great for these applications.  The battery lasts a long time - we often go a week or more without needing a charge.  The USB-C connection is handy now that more and more devices are using this standard.The Bluetooth connectivity is outstanding.  It connects seamlessly and reliably and seems to have quite good range.  Far less finicky and fussy than other Bluetooth devices we use.The unit is durable!  Although advertised as water resistant and absolutely not spec'd for this, my unit fell into the hot tub and floated there for two days.  I was wondering where it went.  Looked all over the house.  My spouse suggested checking the hot tub.  Sure enough, there it was.  I expected it to be dead.  Nope!  It's fine!I do not recommend immersing the unit in water.  I am sure we got lucky.  Nevertheless, we were impressed!",225,4.0,2022,07,July,04

Weak!,1,"I've been throwing a pair of these in pools, hot tubs, the lake - my favorite party trick is the bass spraying water off the sides when you take it out of the water. Yes these are Mono.. thats why you buy two and they pair up with just a single button press on each!! You do have to use the JBL app to marry them into stereo mode but hell... you can't even sync Bose speakers without an app! My only complaint with these? THEY DON'T PLAY MUSIC UNDER WATER LOL. Seriously... get two - you won't be disappointed. The battery wore out in my ""renewed"" one I bought for $69... can't complain because it owes me nothing and I ordered an upgraded battery for it for $35 which brings it to the full price of one of these after beating on it for 3 years. Literally beating on it - taking them EVERYWHERE.",155,2.0,2022,06,June,10

Works good for the price,5,I’ve had this For about a year or two now and it works amazing. I have had it  fully submerged underwater and just being splashed also take us in the shower or gets a little steamy and it works perfectly and all those different conditions. I like to listen to podcasts or music when I go to sleep. So I usually have this playing when I go to bed and it lasts overnight and usually for like a whole week but I usually have my podcast Or music on for only an hour or two but I have the speaker on all night. If that makes sense. The speaker is also really loud and it connects to other JBL speakers really easily which I like. I like to listen to music when I ride my bike so I bought this strap for the JBL speaker which connects it to my bike and The JBL speaker works really well on it. I really recommend this product.,165,5.0,2022,06,June,07

This is our first experience with JBL so I did some comparison research between JBL  and Bose, of which we’ve had various products over the years. The sound is great, color beautiful, and size perfect. I begin using it as soon as I unpacked it. I initially thought the charge cord or guide were missing due to the separate packaging being camouflaged in the box (black on black should be reconsidered, maybe a sticker could be added). Otherwise, we are very satisfied with the purchase.",116,5.0,2022,05,May,24

After seeing a Charge 4 was available and at the se price point as my older Charge 3, I ordered it. Out of the box it has the same great JBL quality.

"Great product, always love JBL",5,"Ive been a huge fan of the charge series since the charge 2, owning every speaker in between then and now. This speaker was seriously a very minor upgrade if not a downgrade from the charge 3... tbh the sound quality is still there, i personally prefer the sound of the charge 3 over this one i think due to the 3 having 2 drivers and this one having 1 single slightly bigger driver... the 3 seems to be alittle more bass heavy surprisingly since its slightly smaller... over all youre still getting the jbl signature sound, it still sounds great, i still think its worth 5 stars, waterproof abilities are amazing and the battery life is totally better, the battery on the charge 3 seemed to poop out on me but only after like 3 years which wasnt to hard to fix... maybe the number of the speaker is the life expectancy 0_o ?! Tune in next time to find out on stephens reviews!!!",165,5.0,2022,04,April,17

Great speaker!,2,I was happy to get the gift from my sister.  Sound quality was great when I tried it out.  Before putting it to full use on my patio. I wanted to fully charge the speaker.  Guess what?  No USB charging cord in the packaging (nor any set up documentation).  Found some on-line but it was quickly apparent that my USB cords for my iPhone would not work to charge the device.  I had to order (what hopefully will fit) a replacement from Amazon.

Wish I would’ve bought black,5,"I like that now when you answer the phone it automatically takes your call off speaker to allow for private conversation. On the older models it would blast right through the speakers, and you'd have to scramble for head phones or run to turn off the JBL speaker.  Thank God I don't have to do that anymore! However, I do wish that it was optional, for only the music to continue softly in the background, separate from phone conversations.  Wouldn't mind having a few more of these around the house, since I think they link together. Love the speakers, Great Sound. Very CONVENIENT for wherever and whenever !",108,5.0,2022,03,March,15

Practical and for the price. I think they are as efficient and the sound quality.,15,"I bought JBL Charge4 recently. It is excellently crafter, extremely durable, produces well rounded sounds for enhanced music experience. For normal people (frankly 99% of population with a budget of =<$150) I would recommend Charge series (3,4,5) speakers. I recently compared it with the shrill voiced Marshall Emberton (that I wanted to buy as I had heard so much about it) and Charge4 is a clear winner for normal “ears”.Durability, water performance, base, power, battery life, looks/color options, and most of all the music that JBL Charge4 produces is way more superior that Emberton.Similar to our routine lives - only ears and good judgement were used for comparison (no technical sensors were used for testing)I am not associated in any way with JBL or HK  or Marshall or any other music speaker brand.",133,5.0,2022,03,March,12

Other than saying I’m very happy with my decision to buy these speakers. For the quality sound and price people I highly recommend you run out and buy yourself JBL HARMAN SPEAKERS. I bought two for myself one for my boat,(by the way the other morning I was fishing listening to my favorite Pink Floyd’s Dark side of the moon. While inside this little cove the sound just exploded it was like the acoustics was all around me. People just one little speaker sitting on the console of my boat.

Nice,1,I always loved JBL products they have amazing sound quality for their price point.

Slightly perfect,2,So I originally was introduced to JBL speakers when the Charge 2 first came out. Loved it and was immediately a fan and remain to be.Fast forward to 2021. I have been telling any and everyone I come across that when ever in question go with JBL so this last Christmas someone baught me the JBL flip 4 and I was just confused. The sound quality the base???? Even the Bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song. Returned no problem. I only wanted a replacement anyway. Received the second one and again like the JBL look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking. I was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the Charge 2. So after getting refund from the second flip 4 spent I think it was an extra 20 25 dollar's?And there it was the sound that made me a fan to begin with. If you're just trying out JBL speakers I would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the Charge models. I see that the flip 4 and 5 have almost a perfect rating on Amazon so maybe it's just my opinion but I believe the quantity all around of the Charge is a better representative of the JBL brand.The battery in the Charge seems to drain quicker than the Flip but I put my speaker threw it's passes from the moment I turn it on in the morning. Until I am ready to relax in the evening. I literally have nothing negative to say about the Bluetooth connection. No problem's at all. The sound quality is just awesome. I love music period I believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically. I listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc. I have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in Base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe 2 or 3 pushes of the button. If you're listening to sax or blues guitar??!! Albert King for example it only gets better the higher you go. Garth Brooks or Lauren Daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on. Even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard. Man I can't wait till I can get enough for the Extreme or the Boom Box. Hope this was helpful to someone. God Bless,433,5.0,2022,02,February,12
Turns on by itself,4,We have this speaker in blue.  Great speaker!  Gift recipient wanted yellow.  Not even close.  Gold at best.  Maybe basketball orange.  Didn't go through the hassle of returning.,28,3.0,2022,02,February,11
Awesome!,1,"When I’m listening while doing chores, it needs to carry through every room and this speaker does the trick. Through dog barks and other household noises I can still hear the song or speaker.The only drawback is that the Bluetooth does not connect to other generations of JBL speakers. Threes connect only with other threes, fours connect only with fours… it would not have changed my particular purchase and circumstance but will affect my future purchases because I will match the system for linking.",84,5.0,2022,02,February,11

Super good!,2,"Came fully charged out of the box. Used it 4 to 6 hours a day delivering mail and packages when time and the route allowed. Sound quality is great for a single speaker that is trying to be a stereo speaker. Would like to buy another to link them for stereo but I don't need that right now. Bought the silicone or rubber thingy that is its protective case. I recommend it for obvious reasons but it really helps keep the damage down if you are going to use it in a violent environment like a postal carrier's truck. Listening to XM or your playlists on your phone has very little effect on the battery. Used it to charge my phone once, not bad but your phone isn't gonna charge fast. All in all, I would buy another one. The sound quality is good enough to want to link 2 of them together and BTW, they are waterproof...to a limit...read the instructions. Not a fan of the app. Kinda useless unless you want to link 2 units or there is a soft/firm ware update.",184,5.0,2022,01,January,09

Great,1,Unit is OK but it is a mono speaker. The sound quality is just not there. My charge 2 sounds much better and trust me it has been used. It does state that this unit only has one speaker but it is worded that if you take a quick glance you would not catch it. It should be stated very clearly that this is a mono speaker unit not stereo like the rest of the charge models. It is an alright unit but had I known it was mono I would have picked a different model. JBL it would be in your best interest to discontinue the Charge 4. Then perhaps you would not get so many bad reviews.,119,5.0,2021,12,December,30

"Sound & weight, perfect for my use.",7,"I own 2 of these now, as I purchased the second specifically because JBL advertises that you can link up to something like 100 of these together to all play the same music. I wanted that for my backyard. While this speaker sounds great on its own, I found the process of connecting it my original JBL speaker to be very challenging and it keeps cutting in and out, very choppy.",71,5.0,2021,11,November,29

Broken and not working,4,"I bought two speakers when I connected them, they were disconnecting oh they were making noises I contacted the seller and he told me to do an update to the system I did it and it was the same I bought another two in case they were defective and it was the same problem I had to return all and my money was returned to me in two weeks it was not a good experience",75,5.0,2021,11,November,26

Very Durable!,2,"I got this one to upgrade from my Flip 4. I really really like it, the battery lasts longer, has great quality sound.

Typical High Quality JBL!,4,"I finally pulled the plug and purchased this speaker and received April 1, 2021.  The sound was just ok,  it didn’t cover the whole house as i would have loved.  The speaker when out October 2021, it didn’t even last a year.  I believe it was due to a shortage in the port.  I noticed earlier on, that the flap to hide the power ports pushed up against the cord while plugged, so my guess is that it finally got destroyed; this is very disappointing given the fact that it is still fairly new. Now I have to spend more money on a new speaker.  The next time I will go ahead and invest in the warranty!",117,5.0,2021,11,November,05
Sounds is great,3,"We are listening to our speaker for a couple of weeks with one charge, at least one hour per day. The sound is great, clear, and may be loud if you want.",32,5.0,2021,11,November,02

Better than expected,3,nothing,1,5.0,2021,10,October,21
Get one!,2,love it works very well! gets pretty loud!,8,5.0,2021,10,October,21
Nothing special,2,"Just got this, so not sure how it will hold up over time. It was VERY well packaged .. could have drop-kicked it without damage. Arrived within stated range. The speaker was nearly fully charged, Charging was as easy as attaching a USB. Came with USB cable, but no adapter .. got plenty of those, so I'm actually happy about the non-duplication. Bluetooth pairing with my Android phone was quick and easy. Sound is a bit base heavy, but is rich and full, no buzz even when cranked, easily filling a 20x20 room. It looks well built and based on my inspection could probably withstand complete submersion. So far, I'm very happy. If it continues to perform well I will buy another one, or more, and link them for a more intense sound experience. The intended use of this speaker is a relatively humid wine cellar.",146,3.0,2021,10,October,20
Great speaker,2,Great gift.  Sound is great. Many Colors to chose from.  Definitely buy from them again,15,5.0,2021,10,October,16
as good as the last time,6,"Note: I've owned these for over six months. I shopped for bluetooth speakers. Bose pricing is insane. JBL had the ""Charge 4"" & the ""Charge 5"" on Amazon. The ""Charge"" models seemed to be very similar based on the item description so I went with this Charge 4 b/c it was less expensive.  I'm glad I did!I don't use this often, but every time I do I'm surprised by the sound quality. Sounds great & the batteries last for a long time.Sometimes I have a bit of difficulty switching from MacBook streaming to iPhone streaming (or vice versa), but I'm sure it's operator error. Regardless, it can be done.  And I'm quite satisfied with the purchase. These are great by the pool in the summertime.",125,5.0,2021,10,October,16
Awesome little speaker!,3,"I gave this to my sweetie for Christmas two days ago. I got a call from him today telling me in detail how he had set it up and used his additional JBL Bluetooth speaker with it as well.He can be quite the critic, being an I.T. Manager😁,  but he could only say wonderful things about how easy it was operate and the quality of sound that was achieved with one small speaker.  Thank you JBL for making my gift to my guy a very special one.",87,5.0,2021,10,October,16
Great speaker,2,My son takes this with him where ever he goes.  The sound is great and the camo is a nice touch for a guy.,24,5.0,2021,10,October,15
Battery life could be better,5,This is my 3rd JBL that has a charger issue! Not cool. The charger outlet on the JBL always breaks then can’t charge it anymore.  Not worth purchasing this product.,30,3.0,2021,10,October,15
Awesome sound quality,3,Loud enough for any home activity and kids parties in public pavilions.Can be connected to laptop (via Bluetooth) to get more volume and bass.,24,5.0,2021,10,October,14
Could be better,3,Love it while it worked.  Great quality.  Suddenly stopped holding a charge (nothing happened to it).  Obviously could be coincidence that it happened right after warranty  Expiration but suspicious enough that I think I will buy a different brand in the future. After a good experience this one I had bought another 1 maybe 6 months ago and we'll have to see if that 1 lasts more than a year now too,72,3.0,2021,10,October,13
It was really what I was looking for,8,This product was well worth the money,7,5.0,2021,10,October,13
JBL Charge 4,3,"I bought this and originally gave it a perfect review because the sound quality is great but the actual quality is not. After less than 90 days, it quit charging and quit working. I called Amazon who offered a refund. When I purchased it, it was $119. They told me they would refund me and then I could order a new one and now they are 149. When it worked, it works great. But it just did not last long on Amazon did not really do any favors with replacing. I’m sure the reason they did not replace it is because the price has gone up or the sale is over. I asked for a replacement and they told me no.  They gave me a refund and told me to re-order so that they instead so I’m sure they can make more money. Not happy and very unimpressed. I do not recommend buying the speaker through Amazon because Amazon seems to be the crappy one here. Go buy it at Costco who will honor the same price and replace it.",180,5.0,2021,10,October,13
I love the speaker,4,Bought for granddaughter and she’s been playing music all day!  She loves it!,13,5.0,2021,10,October,13

Great Quality Sound,3,Not a cheap speaker and I used it for less then 6 months and it just stops. Battery is full and it was a waste of maney,27,4.0,2021,10,October,12
Charging Defect after 6 months of limited use,8,I needed something that could take heavy rain. This made it overnight left out in a Costa Rica rain and was totally fine. Battery is good and I even started to use it for movies. Linking two together was easy and of course much better for movies,47,1.0,2021,10,October,12
For such a compact unit base good,7,The sound a bass i this is perfect for what I was looking for battery life is long and if you are use it and you forget too turn it off it will do it for you,37,5.0,2021,10,October,12
Absolute junk after five months,5,Shipped fast & is louder than other speakers I've bought.,10,1.0,2021,10,October,11

Best speaker ever,3,"I've had this speaker for some time now, like 2 years. Today my wife and I drove from our house to the store about 1.5 miles away in the rain. Turning into the lot, I hear a rattle on top of the car, where I put my speaker when I was cleaning the garage and forgot about.So I whip into a space, freaking out that I lost/broke my speaker forever, but it was still on the car. (Jerking into the space made it fall though). Grabbed it, turned it on, connected, played great! This thing survived a fall off my car after driving 1.5 miles in the rain. No regrets for this purchase.",113,5.0,2021,10,October,09
Dead right after warranty,4,These speakers are AMAZING and nothing short of that I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone even considering them.  We have 4 in our house and sync them together regularly to make the whole house able to hear clearly the music we stream.,42,1.0,2021,10,October,09
Works well! Super portable.,4,"That’s really good, quality and battery life",7,4.0,2021,10,October,09
Good deal,2,"Use it a lot listening to music on social media. Sometimes can be a little muddy in sound, but that may be the audio system from the social media site. Otherwise, very satisfied. There may be larger brands out there at much cheaper prices than the JBL, advertising ""Strong Bass"". But the tonal quality of these cheaper speakers is not that great.",62,5.0,2021,10,October,08
Accidentally left this review on the case.,7,It is all as discribed. Loaded with features,8,3.0,2021,10,October,07
Surprisingly good,2,"After 4 years of heavy use, one of the speakers finally blew. I've really put this thing through the ringer over the years, constantly getting it wet, dropping it off the back of the golf cart, listening to music with the volume at max constantly. This thing is a tank. I have yet to hear a portable bluetooth speaker that can come close to matching the volume output or the sound quality as the JBL.",75,5.0,2021,10,October,07

I may have to buy another one for myself.",53,1.0,2021,10,October,04
The best portable Bluetooth speaker ever! Amazing sound quality!,9,Where is a charging cable? The one I bought 5 years ago had one. WTF? And the rechargeable battery only lasted 5 years and I didn't use it that much. But they do have good sound quality,37,5.0,2021,10,October,03

Great sound,2,"I has purchased charge 3s in the past, great.  The 2 charge 4s will not hold a “charge”.  I have followed online instructions to no avail.  Charge engineers s/b fired, one and all.  Complete FAIL.  Recommend you follow my advice and never purchase a charge speaker.  You will only have yourself to blame.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.",55,5.0,2021,09,September,16
Great product,2,"JBL Charge 4! What a trooper. Went through the window, bent the metal frame, and not a scratch! Wish windows were this durable and girlfriends were more sane! Definitely sticking with JBL!",32,5.0,2021,09,September,15
"Great purchase, truly satisfied",4," Alright first of all the reason I'm here writing this is I lost one of these off the bed of my truck at about 25mph on an asphalt road. It dropped rolled and bounced into the ditch and I found it a few hours later. (see video) now first thing I thought was this thing's toast. Nope! Not this speaker! Dang thing fires right up and goes right back to playing solid sounds! I love these speakers, I have since day one. I'm here after a year of pretty consistent use to say I still love these speakers. Battery life is great for the sound they put out. The connectivity option to listen with multiple at one time is the reason I bought them and I love that. 10/10 would buy again! Jbl or bust in my book.",138,5.0,2021,09,September,15
great amount of volume and decent quality for such a small speaker footprint,13,This thing almost Caught Fire !!!

Amazing little speaker!,3,This purchase bangs more for your buck!!!!,7,5.0,2021,09,September,08
Good little home speaker,4,"I bought one to use outdoor around my pool and loved it so much I got  a second second one to use in stereo mode. Battery life is incredible and lasted over a week with 4 or5 2 hour swims.  The fact that they are weather resistant is a big plus as mine have both been splashed quite a bit. I put 1 under the diving board on 1 end to keep it out of direct sunlight and heat and the other one is at the opposite end of the pool under a pool chair. These have bass, crisp highs, and they will really crank up the volume but I don't annoy my neighbors. Takes less than 2 minutes to turn on and connect to eithet my phone or tablet. The tablet option is nice on a stand if I want to watch a football game while taking a swim. 5 star HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",154,5.0,2021,09,September,08
JBL doesn’t have lasting quality,5,Gets loud enough to hear outside in the yard.Crisp sound.Great sound.,11,3.0,2021,09,September,06
This speaker emits ungodly radiation.  I will contact JBL.,9,Very nice quality both in sound and rugged design/construction.  Big sound even in a large room.  Battery lasts a long time.  Easy Bluetooth connection to my iPhone works every time with no hassle.  Typical Bluetooth range.  Its fine as long as the phone and speaker are in the same room.  Almost all Bluetooth things are that way unless they have a stick antenna and cost a lot.,67,1.0,2021,09,September,06

Sound quality,2,Sound is amazing and design is beautiful.,7,3.0,2021,09,September,05
Quality,1,There is no audible warning when the battery is low. The indicator lights are at the bottom of the speaker. The way you know is when the speaker turns off in the middle of the night and you fumble with the charger while the speaker keeps turning off until the battery gets a charge. Sound quality is nothing special considering the price and the JBL brand.,66,5.0,2021,09,September,03

Great speakers!,2,"If you're looking for a portable speaker for casual outings or at home, I'd say this is a great purchase. If you're someone like me who works in the kitchen from 8-9 hours, this speaker probably isn't worth it with it's battery life. I kinda expected it, but I didn't even have it on max, and it ran out on my 7th hour, which was actually almost over an hour off from my other speaker I still had. Pretty large for something that looks like it would have longer charge, but that's kinda my only gripe. At least it sounds nice.",101,5.0,2021,08,August,27

Nice portable speaker at this price point,7,I bought I bought it as a gift for my husband but I use it sometimes. it’s not too loud. Very portable he loved that we take it to the beach with us every time we go. Easily connects to bluetooth.

Great party speaker,3,Very nice for listening to my YouTube songs out in the yard!,12,4.0,2021,08,August,14
A great speaker,3,Thought I was buying the good loud one.. not as much volume as I'd like on the beach.,18,5.0,2021,08,August,14
Awesome speaker,2,"I am a senior citizen and have always considered Bose the standard in speakers, but this product exceeded my expectations. I got it refurbished and so it was a great bargain. Works great.",33,5.0,2021,08,August,13
Power button failure,3,"This is a large speaker, I read the dimensions but its significantly larger than the Flip series. my only criticism would be that it does not really have a ""quiet"" setting, even the lowest it can go is still sometimes a little louder than wanted. That being said, it sounds great, can be very loud, and we haven't had any issues yet.",62,2.0,2021,08,August,13
Excellent,1,This speaker has plenty of sound while I’m in my boat.,11,5.0,2021,08,August,09
Bluetooth distortion,2,I love the quality of the sound.  The device is easy to set up and it pumps out great bass and treble.  My house has concrete walls throughout the house so I can't use it beyond line of sight of my laptop. I would definitely recommend this,47,1.0,2021,08,August,09
It’s very loud and has a lot of bass it’s perfect,11,Hopefully they will do the right thing.,7,5.0,2021,08,August,03
Best value,2,"I bought this about 15 months ago and it worked perfect.  In the course of normal use I turned it off and then went to plug it in immediately after.  I noticed the unit wouldnt charge and proceeded to try several other chargers to no avail.Since product is slightly more than 1 year old, JBL is offering to give me the names of local repair shops that I can pay out of pocket to fix this.  Shoddy workmanship for a premium product that is more than likely designed to break after warranty so you'll have to buy another.I just dont get how it can work.... and after turning if off while working... it would proceed to NEVER turn on again.  IF you want to throw away $150 every year then this is the perfect speaker for you.  I was offered a 30% discount on a future speaker but that is not the answer I wanted or expected.",157,5.0,2021,08,August,02
Love it! Great bass.,4,"The sound is awesomely fantastic! JBL is worth every penny.The bass is beautiful! The battery is long lasting.I can charge it to full and I don't hav to charge it again for another 3,4 days sometimes longer.JBL is a great product! I tried other Bluetooth speakers.Always go bak to JBL.No comparison!",51,5.0,2021,08,August,02
Works good for our patio setup,6,stop working one after purchased.  no help from amazon to replace.,11,5.0,2021,08,August,02
Great for the price,4,"I have always loved JBL products, and this speaker doesn’t disappoint whatsoever. For a portable Bluetooth speaker, this thing BUMPS! Like can hear it all over a 3 bed/2 bath house. For an apartment, your neighbors might get mad if it’s too high. The battery life is really good, with many hours of use even at higher volume levels which drains the battery much faster. The sound quality is awesome, with great bass and clarity. Bluetooth connection is quick and easy, and you can go pretty far away with your phone in your pocket, and it won’t skip a beat. And of course it’s called the Charge cuz you can charge other electronic devices with the 5W USB charging plus. That’s a dope addition to an already great speaker. Finally, the value for the money spent to purchase this, and it’s DEFINITELY worth it’d price and then some. The Charge 5 is $179.99, and I got this Charge 4 open box brand new for $109.99. That’s an insane deal, thanks to Amazon haha. My favorite Bluetooth speaker of all time!!! 10/10",181,4.0,2021,08,August,02

easy set up great sound,5,The volume is as high as the JBL Flip 4 it looks bigger but it’s not as high.It was a huge disappointment what’s the point of it being bulky if the sound is not high.Stick to the flip cheaper and sounds exactly the same.,44,5.0,2021,08,August,01
Awesome!,1,Unfortunately I am lucky to get 8 hours out of the speaker. I was sure I wouldn't get the full rated hours but really figured I would get more than 8. Otherwise a great speaker.,35,5.0,2021,07,July,31

I'm charge my Phone with the charge 4 every time. very satisfied.,12,"Dad's a bit deaf, and had Bose stuff in the past. He asked me to order him a Bose version of this. After some research, I bought this instead (JBL Charge 4). Dad loves it. It works great and plays loud. Sound quality is better than I would have expected from a small speaker, but it's a MONO speaker... so not exactly highfi, and it's in NO way a reference monitor. For what it is, it's great!",77,5.0,2021,07,July,27

Excellent Product and works well,5,"The speakers sound amazing and the two that I purchased immediately paired using the JBL Connect App. My only concern is that neither charging door closes tightly or seals shut, which makes me believe that they wouldn't be waterproof since water or liquids would easily enter the USB ports.",49,5.0,2021,07,July,20
Totally worth it!,3,"For its size it pounds out the music with surprising clairity and volume. Bass is astounding for its size.Perfect size for on the go with bikes, side by sides, camping and not to mention water use on the boat or beach with being water resistant.Solid science behind this unit.Worth every penny.",51,5.0,2021,07,July,20

Have Speaker Will Travel,4,First let me say that this JBL portable speaker isn't a toy.This has weight to back up the power sound it brings.So if your looking to bring your party anywhere this speaker will bring it.It's also waterproof. But I don't recommend anyone taking there party to the shower.Sound check!,49,5.0,2021,07,July,18
Not charging,2,"My neighbor had this version of Bluetooth speaker, and bought one for myself to listen to tunes while sitting at my desk. My coworkers love how it sounds, it’s reception range, the clarity without any distortion and it motivated one coworker to buy one for himself. The battery stays charged for quite a long time.

What I was looking for,5,"We have had STEREO technology since at least the early sixties.This unit?

Best speaker !,3,"I had an older, smaller JBL and the battery stopped holding a charge.  I upgraded it to this larger unit.  The sound is great and the larger battery lasts a long time.

Fantastic sound and the ability to link multiple speakers together for that theater sound,14,All I can say is that I use it a lot.  This is going to sound stupid but I really don't remember the last time I charged it.  I mean I don't use it everyday but at least 2 to 3 tines a week for at least a couple of hours.  Sometimes I bring it in my garage as I am working on a project so it will be on for 3 to 4 hours.  It still shows 3 lights for charge.  Just told the wife the other night as we were listening to it on the deck that I cant believe it still has a charge.,107,5.0,2021,07,July,09

Absolutely love it.,3,"I've read a lot of the ""One Star"" reviews and have to say MY experience is far, far, different.  Following are a few tidbits from my use of these JBL C4 speakers:1)  I have purchased SEVEN  (7) of these from Amazon - five for my daughter and her family and I own two myself.2)  The EQ is controlled from the PLAYER you have connected to these speakers...NOT by the speaker.  I have cycled thru the EQ on my MP3 player and the JBL C4 picks them all up.3)  NO - there is NO separate charge cord...READ the AD - it  says exactly that.  Don't act surprised when you open the box = NO Wall Charger - just a USB cord for charging.4) TRUE stereo separation (for all you audiophiles out there) requires a MINIMUM of three to six feet of speaker separation with home stereos...not likely to be achieved by ANY speaker small as JBL C4 - but a big fat SO WHAT?  I use mine in the shower - put it on a ledge and WOW - wonderful sound quality with more volume than I ever need.5)  QUALITY COSTS MONEY!  You will ALWAYS get what you pay for - go cheap = get cheap.  If you go to the Vendor list and grab the cheapest one out there, don't be surprised when you get a ""look-alike"" which in NOT made by JBL.6) Hooking up a number of these speakers and spreading them around the room may sound as if the signal was getting to some slower than others, appearing to be a ""LAG.""  ALL of the speakers are getting the SIGNAL at exactly the same time...what you are experiencing is the audio output ""DOPPLER"" effect (I'll let you look that definition up by yourself).  So - space the speakers closer to each other.7) Battery life - you WILL  experience a great deal of battery life IF you keep the volume down to a reasonable level.  Crank it up to full blown PARTY TIME and it will eat up battery power.I truly hope my comments help to answer some of the questions posed about the JBL C4 speaker.  NO - I do not work for Amazon or JBL.  I am simply a USER wishing to put light on some misunderstandings.  John",381,5.0,2021,06,June,13

Previous model waaay better,4,Sounds so good. Plays for hours on single charge,9,2.0,2021,05,May,12
recommend 100%,2,"This thing is terrific. It has a shocking amount of bass for a small speaker.  JBL pretty much nailed the design.  If I were to complain it would be that the base is a little narrow.  I use the speaker by my pool and I dont want to bump the speaker and it roll into the pool (again.. :-) )For you people that are complaining about it being mono - Its an engineering choice to deliver performance in other areas.  Do you have to have stereo drivers that will be 8 inches apart?  Is that REALLY needed? Of course not.. If that bothers you, there are a ton of other devices that might be a better fit, but I doubt it will deliver as well in the other areas.  I have an old BT stereo speaker and it does not come close to delivering sound on par with the Charge 4.Going mono delivers more volume, longer battery, lower heat, and simplified controls.  Bass sucks power..  This thing gets pretty damn loud and really delivers a ton of bass.  I stream to it in the backyard when swimming in the pool..  It has really been great.  It has been accidentally kicked into the pool a few times.. but no damage, and it has proven to be water resistant as advertised.",219,5.0,2021,05,May,29

So far the best bluetooth speaker I ever bought,9,"If you are buying this most probably you have done your research, and for me, it lives up to its expectation. The speaker delivers deep bass for something of its size and is loud enough to fill a large room. If you want to use it outdoors It will definitely get the neighbors wondering if you're having a party. It gets pretty loud without getting distorted and at around 80% is when there is sound distortion. Great for movie night in bed and for listening to music. Having owned the Flip 4 twice this is definitely an upgrade especially with its charging, but I wish it had a strap or handle like the bigger and smaller versions of this speaker and I wish it had a microphone sometimes, but I also understand why they didn't include it on here.",139,5.0,2021,05,May,21

Very good,2,"A little difficult trying to tie to of them together. Finally found the trick turn both on let them automatically connect to phone. One connected, hit the stereo mode buttons at same time. For me it worked every time. Have to buy two atleast because in stereo mode they sound great. Bass is decent not as much as I like but they have great sound quality. So if your a sound quality and not a bass person these are good.",80,5.0,2021,05,May,21

Superr,1,"I love this speaker. It’s really awesome. It’s loud. It’s cute. The only thing I don’t like is the fact that I haven’t had it for very long and the fabric is dingey. I keep it in my case when not in use and it barely gets touched, just moved from one spot to another if anything. I’ve tried wet cloths and all that but it’s just a weird uncleanable material.",71,5.0,2021,05,May,20
same as described,3,"We have two other, smaller JBL speakers (Flip 4) which we really liked, but wanted a bit larger one to connect to those, to have a full stereo effect - and we're not disappointed!

"Will definitely recommend, Price well worth the product for Bluetooth.",10,"This is a great standalone bluetooth speaker. Unfortunately JBL Connect+ is wildly unpredictable so if you want to connect multiple, compatible JBL speakers using this technology you will experience lots of dropouts of one or the other of the speakers.

After unsuccessful attempts to find the owner, I ended up keeping it.  I figured after being dropped and rained on, it wouldn't work.  But it did!

Great sound,2,"Quality of sound is good however volume level compared to previous model sucks, and the Bluetooth changed so now the old models can’t connect to the new models, that’s really dumb to not have back compatible technology. My sister has previous model and it fills a back yard of several acres. I can barely hear this across my warehouse, would say it’s 1/2 to 3/4 as loud as previous. Bought it to hear above the refrigerator units and its disappointing for the price. Oh well I guess that’s the price you pay for buying something online that you can’t hear the exact unit first.",104,5.0,2021,04,April,17

Great little speaker,3,"This product has malfunctioned and been glitchy sine the day I got it. The Bluetooth never worked properly, with the unit automatically disconnecting and shutting off. I kept assuming “operator error”, but that is not the case. I have done factory reset and googled troubleshooting. I have barely used it and it no longer charges; intermittently connects on Bluetooth. For a few days this speaker would work when directly connected to my phone. However, after 20 minutes the unit automatically turns off (while plugged in to power). Troubleshoot on the web revealed many problems. Don’t buy this.",97,5.0,2021,04,April,14
Sound is great,3,"JBL speakers are trash when it comes to battery. I had the JBL xtreme and the battery wouldn't hold a charge, it had to be plugged in to use it. Finally threw that one in the garbage and bought the charge 4. Three weeks in and the speaker won't charge at all. The sound quality isn't that great either, sucky bass and only has one speaker on the right side. It's not worth what it costs. This speaker should be no more than $60.

Packs a powerful punch for a small speaker,8,"An attractive, high performing speaker that exceeded my expectations. First the bad news: I did have difficulty at first pairing my phone with the speaker. The included instructions were no help and I would have liked to see a bit more detail; it's just a series of what look like comic book panels.  I begrudgingly downloaded the JBL Portable app, found a bit more information and was able to pair. Straight out of the box, the sound is a bit disappointing. The speaker did not produce much bass and was really heavy in the upper midrange and high frequencies. I would highly recommend downloading an equalizer app on your music source device.  Now the good news: The equalizer made this speaker come alive. Volume for days, and more bass that I would have expected for a speaker this size. The fact that it can also charge your music source device is even more reason to select this speaker.",158,5.0,2021,03,March,26
Awesome Buy,2,Awesome sounds for this little speaker! I also like how you can use it as an external battery to charge other devices. Hopefully it will survive the AZ summer heat next to the pool. Updates to come.,37,5.0,2021,03,March,25

Charge4 thumbs up!  Some reviewers here need a refresher on Mono vs Stereo,13,"Someone gave me a Charge 3. I bought a Charge 4, thinking I could pair them. Nope.So I bought another Charge 4. Pairing is difficult if you desire stereo sound, as opposed to two mono speakers. Had to get a second JBL app and attempt to import my music into it, some of which won’t play. When I do get it to play in stereo, it doesn’t stay that way for long. The hardware/software combo has been finicky and temperamental for me.Also, Amazon is not letting me add an informative photo.",91,5.0,2021,03,March,21

good,1,"Love it so far. Got it, was basically fully charged and played all day at the pool...barely saw any decrease in power. Love the sound and the good bass. Able to control sound EQ via the settings on my phone (for those recognizing it doesn't seem to have an EQ in an app or something. We are stepping up from the JBL Clip 3 (which is also really great! just doesn't have the volume we wanted for a patio or at the pool). Fills a locker room full of sound easy too. Able to listen at low volume and still have full depth of sound.  Many commented about the mono sound aspect, but honestly, I love this sound. It's full, and the highs/mids are pronounced with clarity, no distortion.My only nit is that it definitely will muffle if like a towel is over it or something... not really worth knocking my rating tho (had it in my sport bag and could notice a decrease in clarity).Solid purchase, very happy with it.",171,5.0,2021,03,March,20

"Good sound, but not the bass your looking for!",9,"luv this speaker.  was disappointed when i received it cause it looked small and i thought how such a speaker of this size could satisfy me.  but then i hooked it up and wow.  I downloaded an equalizer app from the google store and now have full control on my listening pleasures and great sounds.  i can control the sounds thru my tablet, the speaker itself and the equalizer app.  all three have volume control.  truly, not sorry i bought this speaker.  I take it with me , hook it up in the trunk of my car and the sound just resonates with the truck door open.  the enclosure of the car trunk makes the sound incredible.  great buy.",119,2.0,2021,03,March,17
Great price for a great sound.,6,Took it to work with me a few times and had my job feeling like a club with how much base it pumps out and the sound is crisp and clean.,31,5.0,2021,03,March,17
Not enough bass,3,"I am blown away at how poor this product truly is. At first I thought it didn't work at all because there was no sound, but apparently a half charge is not enough for there to be sound but once it was fully charged it worked. Once getting the product working I turned on some music and the amount of bass ruined the music, I had to download an equalizer app just to get the music to even sound decent and not crackle. I took it to work the next day with a full charge and went to use it and again no sound. I turned it off and took it home still with a full battery. Went to try it again a few days later and the battery was drained even though it had been turned off. Overall I am impressed with not one thing about this speaker. And you are proud to charge as much as you do for this product? I'd have better success buying one from the dollar store.  Do not buy.",176,2.0,2021,03,March,17

Stop sound in two months,5,"Let me start with what everyone is most interested in.  These have great sound quality for the size.  They have better bass than you'd expect but the treble could be a little stronger.  I've turned the volume way up just to see how they handle the power and they hold up well.  You can blast them without worry as long as you have good source material.  I bought 2 so I could output in stereo.  It's a bit quirky trying to get them into stereo mode but it does work.  However, for some reason they glitch occasionally which causes a dropout when playing in stereo.  I think it has to do with the bluetooth communication between speakers.  I'm hoping they can come up with a firmware update to fix it.  I don't have this problem when just using 1 speaker.  All in all I would recommend buying these.",148,1.0,2021,03,March,11

Good buy!!!,2,"Ya know, for almost $200 I thought I'd be more impressed. Sound quality isn't bad but the bass interferes with the sound quality and makes it wobbly to where I'm scared to play it loud. Ue doesn't do that :/ like others mentioned too it is a mono speaker which isn't great when I'm looking for full directional quality sound",60,5.0,2021,02,February,28
Very difficult to connect to,5,I bought this for our wrestling room which is very large and this just isn't quite big enough for that.  I do however like the sound and feel it is a very good speaker.  Just know that it isn't for a large area.,43,1.0,2021,02,February,28
Not so bueno!,3,This is a great speaker light and easy to work basic controls that get the job done with no confusion  I ordered a carry strap for it from Amazon as well u must get the carry strap for hanging and protection.  I gave it 4 out of 5 for sound quality it delivers more bass than treble great speaker for the money.  Claims to have a 15-20 hr battery based on use and is waterproof can’t touch that plenty loud for the beach or backyard,85,2.0,2021,02,February,26
Battery life is great,4,"This speaker is awesome. I was a bit skeptical about the passive radiators, but I was impressed. It doesn't pump bass as much as a wired speaker such as Echo Plus, but the sound is still excellent, and the battery life is great. I usually play music off and on during my workweek and charge it once per week. I gave it 4 stars due to the poor USB-C implementation. The speaker charges through its USB-C port, however it is only able to output power (to act like a powerbank and charge a phone, for example) through its USB-A port. My recommendation to JBL is to ditch the USB-A port entirely, and use the USB-C port for charging and power output.",121,5.0,2021,02,February,25
I’m in love with my red JBL speaker,8,Love this thing. Sounds great. Good bass for a small unit. Very satisfied.,13,5.0,2021,02,February,25
I’ve been unlucky,3,"I bought a refurbished one, but it looked brand new and untouched, so I saved a few bucks, and that was good. The green color is cool, much cooler than black, which was my second, more expensive choice. It connected immediately (almost) to my ipad, iphone, macbook. The sound is great. It's very loud, but I don't play it that loud yet. I bought it to use outdoors for music, so I expect it will work well paired with an iphone. It's a simple, compact device, but it delivers great sound. Could not be happier. And it's waterproof, which I hope never to test, but it's nice to know because it will be outside, and might get left outdoors overnight on occasion. Battery life seems fine so far, but I have only used it for a few hours. Time will tell on that one.",144,1.0,2021,02,February,25

This speaker delivers great sound at low, mid, and high range.  It can also play very loud, although we keep the volume pretty low to be respectful of our neighbors.I would recommend this speaker to a friend.",65,4.0,2021,02,February,24
Great gift!,2,"I've had this speaker for well over a year now.  I use it full volume in the shower while its soaking wet and also outside on the patio.  I've had it connected to my smaller TV that I move between porch and patio but my Sony works better for that due to the Sony app to control the volume via bluetooth being much better than the JBL app.  It still looks and works as good as when I first got it.  Battery lasts a good amount of time and it has incredible bass for its size - especially if its placed against a wall or better yet, in an inside corner.  I have been very happy with its quality and performance.Now some negative aspects.  The battery level indicator lights are placed very low so they are not visible in most cases and then the unit just goes dead with no warning when the charge runs out.  The base is small compared to the speaker so it can easily roll over and off a table if bumped.  Speakers are on the ends so you can't stand it up vertical.  It does make a loud melodic sound when turned off.  It is pretty rugged and waterproof so the addition of a case adds no value, is just another useless item cluttering your life and is environmentally negative.  I suggest getting one without the case.  The current price is much, much more (50 percent more) than when I purchased it - maybe due to Covid price gouging or just rampant inflation.  Never buy a used product that requires a built-in battery as someone is unloading it because its defective or reached its end of life even if it still looks like new.",289,5.0,2021,02,February,24

Awesome sound,2,"Practically all bluetooth speakers are MONO, it has nothing to do with how many drivers/speakers/cones it has.  To get stereo sound you usually need to have two of the same (or typically at least the same brand) bluetooth speaker and send different audio (Right or Left) to each one.The Charge3 had two forward facing mid/high range drivers driven by same signal so they effectively acted as one driver/speaker.  Charge4 replaced the two forward facing drivers with a single larger higher quality forward facing driver that produces better depth and definition, at least in my opinion.  I'll take the Charge4 over the Charge3 (or the Flip5) any day.",107,5.0,2021,02,February,06

Good!,1,I had high hopes for this JBL Charge 4. It’s a good name brand with good reviews. I gave it a shot but couldn’t get used the the mono sound and the fact there’s no equalizer. My ears just weren’t happy.The Bluetooth worked great. It’s solid and connected every time with no issues. Battery life seems good though I haven’t kept it long enough to actually confirm this.I am returning it and keeping the Soundcore Motion Boom which I purchased a week later as a comparison.

Best portable speaker I've owned,5,"Received for Christmas in December and it stopped working in the beginning of February. While it was playing music it stopped and has not turned back on since, despite being charged over night and it being a month later of trying everything to make it work again. No lights or sign of life. Strongly would not recommend.",57,5.0,2021,01,January,31

Highly recommend this speaker!,4,"Sound quality is decent for the price point in the segment. One complaint is the lowest volume setting is too loud for an office setting, which was the main purpose of my purchase. The drivers are OK for the size but don't expect to hear all the lows from your music. It's better than most but for the money, I'd rather have spent a little more and gotten a larger, more versatile speaker.",73,5.0,2021,01,January,27

I love this speaker!!,4,I use this product all day and the battery only gets down to half! It sounds great and is easy to use.,22,5.0,2021,01,January,07
"Times change, technology advances",4,"First of all, the speaker is MONAURAL and you need TWO to get stereo. That's $360! Then you need an app to convince the speakers to play in stereo, and THERE IS NO APP FOR WINDOWS OR MAC, only mobile devices. I tried an Android emulator but you can't get to Bluetooth that way, so forget it. The app is crappy, too. It takes at least two tries each time to convince the speakers to play in stereo and the app has to be left running. After a while something times out, the sound reverts to monaural and the app has to be closed and re-started to make it stereo again. The only reason this speaker gets so many good reviews is that apparently most people don't care about stereo sound! What a waste. So, good sound or not, these are going back. Both of them.",146,5.0,2021,01,January,22

JBL Charge 4 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Gray,10,Overall a great product. I really like the feature of connecting another to it. I take this on bike rides and my buddy who has one shares music on both speakers as we ride. It has one speaker but sounds great in small to medium size rooms. This thing holds it charge and a great feature is that it’s also a battery pack for cell phones.,66,5.0,2021,01,January,16

My husband loves it,4,"This thing gets loud! It's the best of both worlds because you get something light and easy to carry, but still get amazing sound. Battery on the beach goes 10+ hours consistently and we like our music loud. I also like that my wife and I can both sync our phones to it at the same time and switch from phone to phone. With my old speaker, we could only have 1 phone synced at a time and we always had to go through the process of disconnecting the current phone then re-sync the new phone by putting the device in ""find new device"" mode.  Now, it's a simple process to turn the BT off on her phone and mine will automatically connect because it's already synced. Vice versa to connect her phone back to it.",136,5.0,2021,01,January,15

The sound from this speaker is incredible!,7,Welll.. it’s gonna be a no from me .. it’s not very loud at all it was kind of a disappointment compared to other cheaper Bluetooth speakers I had. Battery life? It lasted maybe 2 1/2 hours on a full battery charge .. which is also a disappointment.. as far as Bluetooth connectivity I had no issues connecting it to my phone which I guess is the only good thing I can say about it it . I definitely would NOT recommend. Just my two cents :),87,5.0,2021,01,January,14

Great battery and sound....,4,Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas! I ordered the navy blue one. I was greatly surprised how wonderful the sound quality was.

Not a bad purchase,4,"Kicks ass. Booming bass. Best I've ever had as a portable, water-resistant, outdoor speaker. (Works great indoors too) Volume gets loud and not seemingly throttled like other speakers.At a small, distanced, campfire among pod sharers, we linked 3 speakers and it was incredible. The 2nd and 3rd speaker occasionally cut for a second but came back on, in sync too. (Believe it was in relation to distance or blockages from phone-to-speaker, rather than speaker-to-speaker. In other words, speakers around the phone can make a larger circle. Opposed to 'repeating' to go one further from the 'master' speaker in a line. )Recommend getting a case to extend the life of this awesome addition.  Enjoy!",113,4.0,2021,01,January,07
Battery life is terrible,4,My first portable speaker. I love how long the battery can for for. It can charge my phone from 0 - 100 at least 3 time. I only wish it was louder for the size,35,1.0,2021,01,January,06

Perfect but buy a warranty,5,"This thing works better than I expected. So many complaints about the bass, but it seems very good for what it is... after all, it’s not a DJ speaker at a club.

I will be coming back for another one of these they connect to each other for multi room function. also the blue tooth connectivity is great I can go any were in the house with my phone and it does not loose connection or get broken up, and again this is a better speaker than my Bose hands down out of my last several speakers this one is the best.",133,5.0,2021,01,January,04

I use mine a few times a week and it sounds great no matter how loud I have it. My iPhone connects faster to the Bluetooth in this speaker than in my car, and I have a 2017 car so it’s pretty up to date.I’d say I would buy another one, but one is plenty for my needs. Also, it’s such good quality that I don’t think I’ll need to buy another one anytime soon. However, will recommend this speaker to everyone.",97,2.0,2021,01,January,02

Overall rating,2,"The charge 4 does not give the same bass and sound quality as the ""BOOMBOX"" but is really quite awesome in its own respect!  When you consider it is only the size of a small thermos this ""baby"" really puts out!  Great for picnics, poolside, and anywhere you want a compact source of music.

Pretty good,2,"There isn't a whole lot not to like about this product. The sound quality is impressive to say the least. I have yet to find a circumstance where it is necessary to even hit half volume haha. The bass is damn near as nice as the speakers in my car (which I guess isn't saying much, I just have an H&K set up). The battery life is another very impressive part of this buy. I play my speaker probably a good 10hrs+ a day and generally don't have to charge it until the third day of doing this. I have yet to play with EQ functions on the app as out of the box the audio balance was pretty on point. All in all I can say I am extremely pleased with the product.",134,3.0,2020,12,December,31
It's perfect!!,2,"I couldn't be more pleased!  I had been looking to purchase a Bluetooth speaker for my work studio for awhile.

My son recommended this one when he found out what I was about to spend for the other brand.I must say, this was a GREAT recommendation.  The sound is top-notch very good quality sound.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone looking for one.  Easy to use.......Connectivity is easy.......Battery life is good!I will say, the use instructions and power cord were ""hidden"" in the box.  Nice packaging, but, I kept wondering why something like this didn't come with instructions or a charger.  Well, I had to go back and really look to find them in the box.  So, yes, it DOES have instructions and a power cord, just break down the inside of the pretty packaging.  All in all DEFINITELY a 10 out of 10!!!",159,5.0,2020,12,December,30

I would recommend to anyone shopping around for a d*** good sounding portable speaker to purchase at least two - more if you'd like - of these.It took me a moment or two to figure out the JBL connect app, but once I got through it (wasn't super hard), the speakers and app take care of connectivity themselves, all I have to do is jam!!",99,5.0,2020,12,December,30

Buy this speaker,3,"This speaker has stellar sound quality for the money. The base is fantastic for the size of the speaker. I actually didn’t expect it to sound as good as it did. It is waterproof which was just what we were looking for. It’s hard to finda good waterproof speaker that will truly withstand more than a sprinkle of water, but this one passes the test.Our teenage kids love using it to Bluetooth the music from their phones out by the pool so you know it has seen it’s fair share of water.It also comes partially charged which was nice. We had music within minutes of taking it out of the box. It lasts about a week on a charge if we use it intermittently. I’ve never left it on for more than 4 hours at a time so I can’t speak to how long it would last continually off of a single charge.",153,5.0,2020,12,December,21

Great product,2,"Problem with item and seller. Buyer beware ,scam items being sold as working good or like new.. No where did it say reduction in refund it item returned. I first contacted seller and it was broken English and wrong words being used in chat. He told me to turn off item and reset. Well it wouldn't hold a charge and we couldn't  turn item on. We could no do what he was asking. Then he got angry with me and said just return it then. Very unprofessional.  We had item before brand new no problems . This seller sold a damaged item (like new)  and knowingly did.  I feel he did because of how he acted in chat. no excuse do not buy from this man/woman.",126,5.0,2020,12,December,17

"The sound just isn't that good,",6,"I feel like I see this speaker everywhere, and it's a great speaker. Super loud and great quality for the size/price. No complaints there. I have 2 main issues:1: Too much bass. I think it's crazy to say for a speaker like this but it's true. Sounds great for some songs, too muddy in others. I don't need EQ settings, but a bass boost on/off would be nice.2: There's no way to go back one song with the speaker controls. This is legitimately frustrating. I've read the manual and googled it, but the controls let you adjust volume, play/pause, and skip to the next song. I can't go back and replay a song without going back to my phone to control it.",122,1.0,2020,12,December,15

Good but not great sound,5,"I had it for two Months. From the first day, it kept turning on and off  and it became more frequent as time goes by. Also it connects with my devices randomly while all the devices bluetooth connection are disconnected. Now it turns on and off every 15 sec. I drove me crazy. I had to leave it in the basement until I return.  I read that some costumers had the same problem on JBL web site.  it seems like a common problems for this product. I tried to reset but it did not work. I asked for the technical help to JBL support but they asked all the  photo of proof of purchase, serial number, shipping address.... why? What if, I got as gift? I did not like how they treats. I decided to return while I can (3 mos). I did not like the sound either compare with my beats speaker. the sound if more like a boom box, not delicate.",163,3.0,2020,12,December,03

Probably really only good for single speaker use and not pairing 100 of them together as advertised.Everything else about this speaker is awesome!  I through it in a snowbank last weekend after having it for several months, and it sounded great and continued working.  I figured if the pairing sucked, then I would start testing out the other features they advertise.  Water resistance was a successful test.",82,1.0,2020,11,November,04
Urine complexion but thumping bass,5,"Depth of sound it’s just a notch below the Bose speaker I bought four years ago, but Bose quality has now gone down so I am happy with this JBL  one, although it is a bit bulky.

It’s decent,2,"I have owned this speaker for a year now and still love it.Pros:- Great volume and sound. Some of the best bass I have experienced from a Bluetooth portable speaker.- Very durable. I forgot the speaker on the top of my car at one point and this device finally fell off at around 40 mph onto blacktop and bounced down the road. I thought I had just completely ruined my JBL, but other than some superficial scuffing nothing was damaged!- I have used the speaker to play music in the rain and there were no issues.- The battery typically lasts over 12 hours with easeCons:- The volume tends to be to loud. The volume makes big jumps when clicked so occasionally I just can't hit that sweet spot. It also doesn't go low enough for quiet study music (at least for me).",142,4.0,2020,10,October,24

jbl charge 4,3,I was surprised about the great sound. It connected almost by itself with my computer. It makes my computer sound system sort of portable. Disappointed that the receiver sound stops as soon as I connect the JBL. Computer cannot send a bluetooth signal and a hard wired signal (to the receiver) at the same time. Maybe I need a new computer.,61,5.0,2020,10,October,18

Must have speaker for long bicycle rides!,7,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out the charging adapter didn’t come with this speaker. It’s expensive enough, you’d think they’d include like they did for my charge 3. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and one of the things he loved about the aesthetics of my charge 3 was the vibrant charger! An adapter is something +90% of users will need.. why omit that? Great quality but I give this a 4 star for skimping on the charger.",82,5.0,2020,10,October,17
Excellent product,2,"The sound quality and bass is better than any Bluetooth speaker I have purchased before. I have had zero problems. A long battery life is key for a Bluetooth speaker.

Not worth the money!,4,"JBL as you know prides itself on high-quality sound. This company far exceeds anyone's expectations when it comes to great-sounding audio, and solid build quality. The JBL Charge 4 is a very rugged and tough water proof speaker that really delivers on high-quality sound.This portable speaker is great for any party no matter the type and it works great with any genre of music. When I purchased this speaker, I already knew what I was getting because I had heard this speaker inside a church where they had 3 of them going all connected together, and quite frankly, they sounded like a very expensive sound system. And due to the wide expanse of the church's sancturary, the bass resonated very well from the music, and all the mids and highs were also there. There isn't a bit of speaker hiss or distortion from these speakers no matter how many are connected.Oh, let me tell you about stereo mode. Now that is really sweet! JBL really knew what they were doing when they implemented stereo mode for these speakers because let me tell you. The stereo mode makes the music quite emerssive and realistic. JBL's sound signature is great, and it definitely deserves a 5 star reward for excellence and quality.The fact that you can connect 100 of these together means that you can have sound all around you if you like. Believe me, you'll be amazed at the bass that these little guys put out, and the great stereo mode when connecting two of them together. I listen to all genres of music, but my favorites are EDM, House and Trance, as well as Country, 80s, and  Soft Rock. EDM music really bangs on these. You will have your own version of the clubs when you use these speakers. Other genres of music sound great on them as well thanks to JBL's signature sound which is extremely clear and detailed without any distortion whatsoever. And, since today's music is all digital, you need that kind of sound because nothing else will do. The JBL Charge 4 speakers are definitely a 5 star in my book, and I urge everybody to get 1, a pair, or 100 of them if you can afford it haha!As far as a comparison between other similar speakers, these put Bose to shame. A matter of fact, they blow Bose clear out of the water! Bose ain't got nothing on these speakers guaranteed!Now Sony is a good runner up, but Sony has a small problem with sounding a little muffled in my opinion. I actually own the JBL boombox, and that monster really cranks out the bass and it is very loud! The Charge 4 speakers are also very loud too for their size which is why I am so impressed with them. I also love the fact that they have an IPX7 rating which means that you can put them in the water. Yes you can use these speakers in your shower. You could take a shower in stereo! Yep, a totally water proof stereo. Now isn't that something? Hey if you had a smart phone that was also water proof, the entire stereo system could go in the shower with you. haha! Hmmm! a new adult pool toy, your water proof stereo!So, if I were you, I would get these bad boys today, and let the party begin!",564,1.0,2020,10,October,15

Sounds excellent.,2,I GOT MY JBL CHARGE 4 AND IT WORKED WELL UNTIL THE BATTERY DIED AND THEN IT WOULD NOT LET ME CHARGE! DO NOT BUY!,25,5.0,2020,10,October,13
Sound quality is great.,4,"What can I say? This is hands down the best waterproof portable Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a few. JBL has a household name for a reason, and rightly so. The sound is amazing, especially the bass. Great range, and even better battery life. The fact that you can charge your device from it is awesome, but the link feature has to be my favorite aspect. Link with your friends who have the same family of speakers with one button for multi source audio- I’ve got a few friends with them and it always enhances the experience. Also more than one device can pair simultaneously which is super neat. Highly recommended!",114,5.0,2020,10,October,11
Tough!,1,I thoroughly enjoy this LBJ Bluetooth speaker,7,5.0,2020,10,October,11
JBL CHARGE 4,3,Amazing sound quality - Battery life is horrible. Takes forever to charge. Might as well get a wired speaker. Great bass sound but that fact the the speaker is unusable due to battery life I give this a 3 star.,40,5.0,2020,10,October,10

Bad Experience. W,3,I love this thing. I live on cal fire center and all my buddies here love this thing. Definitely would recommend the sound on this thing bumps!! Battery life is great as well and best part about it is it charges your phone too if you connect it through usb!,50,1.0,2020,10,October,08
Super,1,"just what i expected.  better than most cheap (under $50) portable bluetooth speakers.  As far as sound quality goes, its just ok.  honestly i was hoping it had better sound quality but it doesnt, but for a portable battery powered bluetooth speakers it meets expectations for the price.  low frequencies (bass) is ""OK"", mid frequencies are ""OK"" and high frequencies (treble) are also just ""OK"".  I would have preferred they made it not waterproof and had better sound quality - i don't really care if it's waterproof or not - especially if that feature is going to sacrifice the sound quality",101,5.0,2020,10,October,08
Perfect for pool area,4,"Bought this to replace a little UE that i had.This speaker has NO bass, No mids, its loudest volume is nothing compared to my much smaller speaker.Returning this after one day.",31,5.0,2020,10,October,08

My best bluetooth speaker,4,Very fine bluetooth speaker.  Once again JBL builds a quality product.,11,4.0,2020,10,October,08
Power button problems,3,"The Aux on the JBL Charge 4 is poorly designed - the speaker will turn off between songs or podcasts if there is a delay, extended silence, or short period of low volume section, causing parts of the song to missed for a few seconds while it tries to turn back on. This creates interruptions if you are trying to listen to yoga or meditative music or podcasts. I have two of them with the latest firmware 3.0.0 and they both have this issue.It appears many others have already commented on this issue. Apparently, this was an intentional design by JBL to save power, but it defeats the purpose of the Aux port.The bluetooth range and party range is mediocre. You can't leave the room with your phone or it will cut out.",133,2.0,2020,10,October,07
Better speakers for your money,5,Its great !Good sound quality and style !,8,1.0,2020,10,October,06

Good speaker,2,Great quality and good bass for a speaker it's size,10,5.0,2020,10,October,06
Great quality speaker! Can’t go wrong with JBL,8,"everything about rhis speaker I love. You get what you pay for is true here. I bought a few different ones and borrows a few friends speakers and compared them all and this one is well worth the cost. The volume and sound range and clarity was noticeably better with this speaker compared to all the others. The battery life is great, I've had it at 25-50% of max volume for about 16 hours and it shows 4 of 5 LEDs lit. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for powerful portable speaker",93,5.0,2020,10,October,05
The best speaker!,3,Seemed to work well and not muffled compared to my old speaker. I think most if not all of the reviewed have been accurate about the functionality. Able to connect well with any phone and no problems so far. Only had for a short time.,45,5.0,2020,10,October,05

Great sound and holds a long charo,7,"Battery and charge functions step up from next model down in the JBL bluetooth speakers, sound appears to be same quality as model below this one. Heavier than lower model, bigger because of battery.

JBL Charge 4,3,"I have had the JBL Charge 3 for a while.  The sound is good, and what you would expect from a portable, waterproof, battery powered, bluetooth speaker.  Anyone who expects studio quality sound from the aforementioned probably truly believes the president they voted for in 2016 is as great as he thinks he is.HOWEVER, there is one flaw in the Charge 3 & 4 that no matter the sound quality or anything else will end the usefulness of this device. The charging port for the Charge is a type 3 and if you don't get the cable in the port perfectly EVERY time, it becomes damaged to the point of being useless.  You are then left with 3.3 pounds of useless junk.  JBL, for this type of product, how about a more substantial charging port.  BTW, what will you give me for 3.3 Lbs. of junk?",146,5.0,2020,10,October,05

loud and clear,3,"Battery life is great. Being able to use it as a charger for other devices, like to charge a cell phone, also a major plus. But where it suffers is the sound quality. As others have mentioned the mono speaker is definitely a weak point. Though the bass output is decent; for its size the speaker barely seems to get as loud as our flip 3. Also when connected via Bluetooth to our Samsung TV for is a quite noticeable lag in audio once again in comparison to the Flip 3.",91,5.0,2020,10,October,02

amazing sound and easy to use,6,"I have never dropped it or damaged it in any way, it barely leaves its shelf, I never listen on full volume- yet the quality turned to absolute poopoo within the past year. I noticed it actually after 3 months and it's been getting worse, the highs and mids sound sooo muddled and it hurts my ears because I listen to rock, metal, electronic, edm and others which are heavy on the percussion and need really good quality sound or it can be heavy on the ears. I'm literally appalled. I'm going to try to get it fixed by JBL hopefully they'll pull through and fix it because I'm really sad and I can't return it anymore ahh.",118,5.0,2020,10,October,01

JBL Charge 4,3,I purchased two JBL Charge 3 speakers one of them quit working within a month I do like the sound out of the smaller JBL Charge 3 better than the charge 4 also the charge 3 has a microphone so you can use it as a speakerphone.  The charge 4 only has one speaker so it is not even stereo.  JBL is very difficult to work with they sent me a charge 4 claiming it was better than the charge 3 for the replacement but it is not and you don't even get a charger to charge the battery on the charge 4.  If I was to do it again I believe I would stay away from JBL.,118,5.0,2020,09,September,29

wouldnt charge,2,Speaker stopped accepting charge after two weeks. Continuously shutdown after a minute of use. Returned accordingly.,16,1.0,2020,09,September,27
Sound quality,2,"The photo compares the flip 4 (smaller) and charge 4 (larger). The charge 4 is well worth the extra $. It’s Louder, more bass and much much crisper sound. The Flip 4 sounds just like the WONDERBOOM - which is fine but not for really enjoying the range of sound of your music.  I haven’t purchased any other Bluetooth speakers so I can’t speak on how these compare to BOSE or other more expensive brands. For my needs in a 1 bedroom apartment— 1 of these in the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom works nicely ! Very easy to connect. Battery life is amazing. Does take time to charge but plays and charges at the same time. They connected to one another easily.",122,5.0,2020,09,September,27
Internal battery only lasted 4 months,6,"I listen to everything from podcasts to classical, rock, and metal on this speaker. It has a great full range including an impressive bass response. The treble is pretty directional and the sound isn't hi-fi for critical listening. I'm very happy with the small size and portability. I can carry this thing around the house or back yard and have my music wherever I go. Overall, I'm very satisfied!",69,1.0,2020,09,September,26

The sound  is great,4,I used two charge 4 speakers in my workshop; wish JBL could make it so both speakers will turn off and on when one turns Bluetooth back on from the same device.

Waterproof is really nice. I bump tunes in the shower and not worry bout messing up my speaker! I also purchased a silicone case that has a strap and now I can carry it over my shoulder. Really convienent for when ur out and about like the beach, outdoor event etc.  The only problem I have is that it doesn't have a microphone. microphone. Have the charge 3. It has a microphone. I use the charge 3 on calls all the time. I can be doing other work in a room and still have a fluent conversation with no hearing issues. That's a big deal for me. The 4 sounds a hair better. Now if it only had a mic.....",151,5.0,2020,09,September,21
Quality,1,"It charges very fast, battery lasts a long time. They still haven't designed a better charging port. The flap pushes on the cable causing weakness in the charge. I replaced my 3 for the 4 after the sound started getting strange, the 4 has the same issue.",47,5.0,2020,09,September,21
My picky husband loves this!,5,"Great looking speaker and the MONO sound is clear and loud. If you're looking for STEREO don't bother with the Charge 4. I'm unable to get my two speakers to play in stereo -- mono party mode only. I contacted JBL Support who said ""I'm sorry, but the Charge 4 is unable to play in stereo at this time. Our engineers are working on it."" And yet, they are still advertising as the ability to pair two speakers to stereo, with no timeline from the engineering department as to when.

Nice sound for a compact bt!,6,"Love love LOVE this thing! Even at low volumes it has a full range of sound. I own an older Bose sound link mini, whose sound it also superb, but this Charge 4 has a far louder range. Bought it for around the home use and our annual trips to the Philippines where things tend to get wet on the beach. Being quite waterproof, that shouldn’t be an issue with the Charge. The Bluetooth connects easily and quickly (no toggling on and off to get it to work as with some older Bluetooth speakers). I haven’t used it long enough, but the battery shouldn’t be any sort of problem at all since it’s a 7500mah (which means it’s allowed on planes!).

The sound is amazing and the battery last forever.  I take it with me on the golf course and people wonder how this speaker can generate such great sound.

Worth the money!,3,This speaker is great. The sound is so crystal clear we were in disbelief the first time we used it. We love taking it to the beach and my fiance always takes it golfing with his friends. The only thing I would change is to make it lighter. It is somewhat heavy and bulky. I wish it was thinner and lighter.,61,5.0,2020,08,August,27
"Amazing quality, would buy again!!",5,"Has deep bass, but wouldn't mind a bit more treble. It sounds great outdoors and that's without turning the volume all the way up. I did have some trouble setting up the stereo mode but I figured it out. We play this whenever we shower, plus when we're getting ready, and we charge it like every three weeks or so. It only takes an hour or two to fully chargeFor Stereo mode: Pause the music and make sure only ONE speaker is connected via bluetooth. Press the connect button on both with the app open. It'll show both speakers together and you can tap stereo below it.  It will NOT work if both speakers are connected via bluetooth - it has to be just one and leave the other unpaired",130,5.0,2020,09,September,11

Speaker is terrible,3,"I bought the JBL speaker May 27, 2020 and have listened to it daily for hours. The sound out of the box was waaay heavy on the base. I found a sound mix app online and used the app to adjust the bass down for a more realistic range. It sounds good.  Now for the impressive part...I perched it on the top of my shower enclosure listening to my fav Pandora station. When you guessed it the speaker dropped 7 feet to the shower pan.. bounced a good foot and landed getting drenched. It was amazing.. never missed a beat. But it gets better.. I didn't learn from that experience and did the same thing, AGAIN (ops)! Second 7 foot fall, bounced, did four 360 degree flips in the shower, and keep on playing.I will definitely buy another one when I destroy this one!! JBL sounds great and indestructible.

Good,1,I’ve had this for about a year or two now and this thing is sick. Sound quality is amazing and I couldn’t be happier. I didn’t want anything too small or too big and this is perfect for taking out and about. It comes with a sling but I’ve never used it. Before getting this speaker I’ve never owned a JBL product and was somewhat apprehensive. I have the blue color because I couldn’t find the green camo. At some point I’d like to get the next size up but for now this will work just fine. I’ve seen JBL products range from $50-$500 and depending on what speaker it is I would totally buy it because I have fallen in love with the brand now.* I bought this at my local Best Buy - not on Amazon.,138,5.0,2020,08,August,28
Watch for unexpected jumps in price,6,"Love the size, feel and color of this speaker. It was very easy to connect to my phone and I've been quite impressed with the sound quality. Even more impressive is the battery life of this speaker. I can go days to weeks without charging depending on how much I play music. Like that you can charge your phone off of it too!",63,5.0,2020,08,August,27
"Great portable speaker, awesome sound!",5,"Perfect, about 3 years with this and still having the same quality",12,5.0,2020,08,August,27
Best 120-150$ speaker,3,"Broke in two months, purchased new from Amazon. Wouldn't power on. Amazon can't return it because it was month over expiration. Should of had a 6 month/ year warrenty. Great product when it worked.",34,5.0,2020,08,August,26
For just over $100 you can’t beat it,8,Signal works at great distance!!!,5,5.0,2020,08,August,26
Love this product but doesn’t include power adapter.,8,This has been awesome for sitting around the pool area. Not having to worry about it getting a little wet. The sound is fantastic. Highly recommend.,26,4.0,2020,08,August,26
AWFUL!  Bluetooth connection cuts in and out only 20 feet away!!,11,"I live in the country and host or go to a lot of bonfires and outdoor gatherings. We discovered a while ago that having a radio wasn't good enough, between a lack of music selection and constant commercials. The JBL Charge 4 is a perfect party speaker solution, and I'm going to leave my impressions based on that use.The speaker is plenty loud if you're on a deck/patio and it's placed several feet away. You'll even need to turn it down to have normal conversation. It doesn't do as well at our large outdoor fire pit, because of the bigger distances and lack of surroundings to close sound in. That space is about 20 feet from a bench on one side of the fire pit to the other, and in an open yard. The speaker is still good, just not great if you like loud, commanding music as I do. If there is a larger group of people (like 8-10+) speaking at once, for example, it will not be able to overtake their voices, and will be reduced to background music. It will also be affected by a big bonfire - the waves of heat will actually distort the sound on the opposite side of the fire.The sound clarity is good. Bass is nothing crazy, but tight and does not distort or sound hollow. As noted earlier, volume really depends on how small a space you're using it in and how many people are talking, but even in the big, open outdoor area, it's perfectly loud with only a few people. Most importantly, when turned all the way up, it maintains a clear, clean sound and does not get distorted like other sound systems/speakers do when you push them. I see some complaints about it being a mono speaker but it sounds fine to me for what it is. If I want unparalleled sound, EQ customization, and other features, I'll buy true audiophile equipment.Bluetooth is easy to connect and a lifesaver technology in general. If you have a cellphone with enough bars and this speaker, you can play as much music as you want. Bluetooth will stay connected at a good distance. I've walked about 30-40 feet from the speaker and had no issues. Not many people would be streaming music very far away from the speaker, I imagine, but it will tolerate a reasonable distance.Charge time is definitely optimistic. It's advertised as being 20 hours but I've not gotten close to that. Fully charged and playing continuously, at full volume, connected via Bluetooth, I've squeezed probably 4-5 hours out of it, which is still plenty. I often just let it charge from an outdoor outlet while playing music.The speaker is definitely waterproof. I've left it outside in the rain a couple of times. I also let it sit on a plastic chair with a recess on the bottom. It rained overnight and I came out the next morning to find it submerged about an inch or so in a puddle of water where it had sat for hours. Powered right up with no issues. I'm glad I tested its abilities, but hate to abuse/neglect any of my stuff like that.If you're doing something similar to me - gathering several friends around a chimenea on the patio, or sitting out back by the fire pit - this speaker is awesome and will be louder than you want when cranked up. If you're looking to entertain a large group of people who are going to be noisy, it's not the best choice but who's really listening at that point anyway.",599,1.0,2020,08,August,25
excellent battery life,3,"I upgraded to the Charge 4 and I must say, the Charge 2+ sounds way better. Thinking about returning my Charge 4 in favor of the Charge 3 due to it not being a stereo speaker, but mono like everyone is saying. Also, the Charge 2+ has crisper sound.",49,4.0,2020,08,August,25
Best choice,2,This charge 4 is really great in terms of sound quality and battery life.... I'm glad I got it for my traveling back to Nigeria.,25,5.0,2020,08,August,25
Best bouetooth speaker I've ever had,6,"These speakers worked well for a couple of months. I play a lot of music so I had to charge them (I have 2) at least once a week. Last week one of them would not power down no matter what troubleshooting I did. Today, the 2nd one wouldn't power up no matter what I did. After doing some research, apparently the power button is an ongoing flaw with this product. My speakers are still under warranty so I am going through the process of having them evaluated and hopefully replaced. However, being my first experience with JBL speakers, which I thought would be bulletproof, I'm sadly disappointed.",108,4.0,2020,08,August,25
Sounds great,2,As soon as I got it1. Never would shut off2. Was barely louder then my jbl flip 53. Noticed awhile ago that no sound comes from the right side of the speakerIdk if this is just a faulty system or if its every speaker but for the money paid definitely not worth it,53,5.0,2020,08,August,25
Great sound in a little package,6,"Love the red, it won’t get dirty easily. I purchased a white before that, and realized the plastic on the sides and bottom will turn yellow over time, so ended up returning the white.",34,5.0,2020,08,August,25

ease of use,3,We got this for my son's birthday and it has been a great speaker. He uses it with his friends all the time on the back of his truck and we have used several times around the pool. The speaker is plenty loud enough to hear over the equipment and it has great bass response for such a small package the battery seems to stay charged forever and we have not had one single issue with Bluetooth connectivity. I also like the fact that you compare this with other speakers to have a true surroundsound when you're out with your buddies or at a party.,105,5.0,2020,08,August,21

nice speaker good quality,4,"I want to start with, i have owned many many many portable speakers in my life because im pretty rough on them, i go racing with them and they get kicked around and covered in dirt and mud and get thrown and all kinds of stuff, but this speaker is by far the best sounding and best quality Bluetooth speaker ive ever had. Its been run through the mill and used every day for multiple months and its still just as good as day one. Very nice battery life also. If you’re in the market, buy this one.",98,5.0,2020,08,August,18

the sound is good,4,"I love the speaker and have  one already.  In this case I  had to get one for a friend with AMZN for a specific reason, but the price charged $179 is grossly over priced.  I could have gotten one at Walmart for $130 all day long, but had to use AMZN for a friend.  Why does AMZN allow this level of gouging?  Other wise, perfect speaker for my purposes.",69,4.0,2020,08,August,17

Worked for literally one minute and then died.,8,"I rarely ever give a poor review on anything but I am very disappointed in this product. The internal battery will not take a charge. I have tried other cables and charging boxes. For the price I paid for this we should expect that it last for years, not months. I purchased the speaker on May 23, 2020 and its now Sept 26, 2020.",64,1.0,2020,08,August,15
Doesn't Charge,2,"Great for the first month. I got 3, now one of them sounds like crap, buzzing on the bass even at moderate volume. I don't blast it, either, so I figure it must be build quality.Update: a second one has gotten flaky after running the power to zero *once*. It is usually plugged in all the time as a speaker for my Amazon Echo, and got unplugged when furniture got moved.Disappointed that a ""flagship"" company like JBL would have such poor quality.",82,1.0,2020,08,August,14
Nice speaker,2,"As described, great product",4,5.0,2020,08,August,14
Love it!,2,The JBL is a good speaker but when you have the audio go up more than 75% the bass levels start to fade out. That is a common problem for JBLs but it still works good,36,5.0,2020,08,August,14
The charger cable is very easy to break,8,"I’ve had this baby for about a year, probably more. Sounds as good as day one. Perfectly water proof in the shower, battery life feels infinite. Bluetooth connectivity is smooth and fast. I adore this thing. Only thing to note is that when you charge your phone with it the battery is drained pretty quick, but it charges surprisingly fast.It’s not gonna be enough volume for a large party, but for a get-together with friends its more than plenty. You can hook up additional speakers if you need extra juice anyway so it’s not even a problem.The mono speaker doesn’t feel mono at all. Everything sounds on point",108,5.0,2020,08,August,14
Perfect Gift,2,Light weight with great sound and battery life.  Don't expect reference series sound but for a portable speaker to use with a cellphone or tablet it provides great sound.,29,5.0,2020,08,August,14

Great build and sound.,4,"This was a gift for my boyfriend and might be stealing it from him xDIt sounds really good indoors, we haven't tried outdoors yet. The sound is clear and the bass sounds great. I was worried because of the comments saying that is mono, trust me that is not even perceptible, it sounds great.We are not party persons so we have not thrown a party using this speaker, we connect it to the tv, laptop or mobile and watch movies, tv shows or listen music. For these type of uses is perfect.",92,5.0,2020,08,August,13

Great go anywhere speaker,4,"Very poor sound, little to zero bass, poor app support, and a miserablr battery life. If you are using this for outdoor or warehouse usage, it will disappoint. Full charge this morning granted 6.5 hours of play at 80% to 90% volume. Quite far beneath the 20 hours promised. If it had lasted 10 hours I might keep it, but the sound just isn't worth $180. Metal music sounds terrible and you have to put your ear up to the speaker to hear it at 100% volume. How does this garbage get passed off as premium stuff? Returning it immediately and taking the leap to Bose.",106,5.0,2020,08,August,12
Light weight good sound easy to pair,7,I link it up to my for TV box while streaming movies.  I use it in my car because my stock stereo is horrible.  I love it more than any other speaker I have ever used,36,5.0,2020,08,August,12
Fantastic sound !!!,3,I really enjoyed listening to the Audible Booktrack books on this speaker.  The background music and sounds are so clear yet not overwhelming the reading of the books.,28,5.0,2020,08,August,12
MANY JBL speakers,3,"I'm a professional musician and spend a lot of time listening to music with a critical ear. I didn't expect much from the JBL, but I was surprised at the sound quality pumped out by this compact unit. Connected to my phone effortlessly. Good bass tones and definition in the highs. Gets pretty loud, too. Highly recommend for when you want music away from your home base.",67,2.0,2020,08,August,12

Genuine review,2,"My husband uses this all the time. We have used this almost daily, inside and outside. It's quite loud! No weenie tin box here!! I'd actually like to get one more so we can sync them up and use them in two different areas! Hopefully soon! I hear that the new version won't sync with the older model so please keep this one available!! :)",65,5.0,2020,08,August,11
Came with problems,3,I bought the Fli4 a few years ago to take with me when I travel for work. I wanted something a little bigger for use around the house and this speaker was a great choice.

LOVE IT,2,I absolutely loved my speaker the sound of my music gets me pumped when I’m doing work so I definitely recommend it,22,5.0,2020,08,August,10
Excellent,1,"I have a Charge 3 that I use on a daily basis and loved it so I decided to purchase the latest version (Charge 4) as a birthday gift since it was on sale for the same price as the Charge 3. That, unfortunately, was a big mistake. I read the reviews about the mono speaker issues and they were spot on. We played the Charge 3 and 4 right next to each other and the Charge 3 had a much richer and more immersive sound.Do not spend the extra $60 for the Charge 4, save your money and get the Charge 3. I promise you won’t regret it.",109,5.0,2020,08,August,10

Very nice product,3,Not only does it sound awesome but the one thing I like about it is when you leave the range of the Bluetooth and come back it turns back on. Just an awesome unit,34,5.0,2020,08,August,08
Not as good I expected,5,"This speaker is the best ever! I had the smaller version of this speaker prior and the battery life was basically nonexistent even with a full charge so I needed to upgrade. I decided to go with this speaker and I'm so happy I did. The batter life lasts FOREVER. I literarily never charge it, or very rarely do, and have yet to have it die on me.

Love it,2,"I’ve owned the Beats by Dr Dre, and it’s bigger, heavier but cannot compare in any way to the JBL Charge 4.  The bass sound is excellent, the size is perfect and convenient to carry from room to room when you’re doing Housework. Bluetooth is strong too. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it doesn’t have a remote.  But I’m totally blown away by the sound quality.",72,5.0,2020,08,August,04
Not Loud,2,"Very skeptical at the beginning. Did Lots of research on competitors. Let's be honest--this is not going to replace a total sound system (if that's what you are dreaming of), but this speaker goes from room to room (and outside) and gives sound that is of high enough quality for you not to feel like you are missing out on something better. I bought this for a family member first, saw how good it was, then bought one for myself within the same week. Battery life is great. I would definitely recommend this.",93,2.0,2020,08,August,04

Always connects.  Runs like a champ.,6,I’m no audiophile but I have been amazed by the sound quality of this speaker. I’m hearing subtle sounds from my classic rock tracks that I have never noticed and this compares to both Bose wave and their portable brick. A friend has the 3 version and I think this has a better sound. The range is superior to any of the bluetooth speakers I have used and I just realized I can keep the phone close because of the 4s charging capabilities. I don’t know if these other reviewers were expecting live philharmonic sound quality because this speaker is awesome.,101,5.0,2020,08,August,03

Great sound,2,"I literally have 0 complaints. I use this at work, at half volume both the kitchen I work in and the kitchen connected to mine can hear the music.

Great sound,2,I was slightly reluctant to buy because of the price but it was worth every penny. Even hooked it up to my 70” TV and it completely changes any movie to near movie theater quality right in your home without the expensive set ups. Love how portable it iswith a long battery life to boot. It’s a daily use for the warehouse I work in for all the music we play at work.,73,5.0,2020,08,August,01

Perfect choice,2,"I just received my charge 4,  but no usb charger came with it.  Do this supposed to come with a charger or just the speaker itself? It’s ridiculous if it’s just sold for the speaker only and you have to to buy a charger separately.",45,5.0,2020,07,July,30
Small but mighty,3,It broke? Only had it a month and rarely used it. The hell!!,13,5.0,2020,07,July,30

Great Sound quality!,3,"Arrived in a broken package that was ripped, wet, etc. The amount of money I spent on it, should warrant a decent product. Not thrilled that I waited a week to receive a garbage product. Very irritating, and very disappointed overall.",41,5.0,2020,07,July,29
Rugged and decent sound,4,"Great sound quality for the medium size speaker, if you want more bass and louder sound go with the xtreme series and smaller get the flip. I returned my flip for this one because I wanted a louder sound.",39,5.0,2020,07,July,29
Great Bluetooth speaker,3,"I find the JBL Charge 4 to be exceptional in all respects and recommend it highly. I am somewhat baffled, however, by the wild jump in price surrounding my purchase. I bought it for $119.95. It was not on sale. Three days later the price had jumped to $179.95.  I don't think the original price was a mistake because that was the price for the product in all the different colors offered. A 50% jump in price seems extraordinary. Is it worth $179.95? In my opinion probably but that is for you to decide.",94,5.0,2020,07,July,29
Flip 4 and Charge 4 together to create an apartment-wide sound system,12,"The absolute best Blue Tooth speaker money can buy!Crisp clear sound with hard-hitting bass, can charge your smart phone and can withstand being submerged in water.I got a great deal on this bad boy and bought the coolest color available.

Great speaker,2,Jbl speakers are the best in terms of Quality/money. It's my 3rd speaker and they are great!,17,5.0,2020,07,July,28
Sounds great easy to set up and use,8,I’ve had the flip 1 for 6 years just started going out so I hope the longevity is the same for this one. Obviously the sound quality between flip and charge 4 is way different but instantly impressed. Love that now I’m able to charge in the truck now. Definitely makes some great sound in about 400 sq ft. We use these as a kitchen speaker while we cook. It’s amazing have had this for about 2 hrs. If any severe inconveniences come along I will update this. Jbl has been a long favorite of mine.  Btw I’m an audiophile and have installed at least 25 car audio systems.,109,5.0,2020,07,July,28
Battery doesn’t last,3,This product is amazing. The color looks great and stands out. Battery life is impressive. Only problem and reason not to give 5 atar is the fact this product doesn’t include the plug in ac USB port only the cable.,40,2.0,2020,07,July,28
Great speaker!,2,"The sound isn't as good as I had hoped, but the awful range of the bluetooth was the absolute deal-breaker.  Fully charged, it can't keep a solid bluetooth connection to my computer that's literally 20 feet across the living room.  It breaks up so bad that it was unbearable to listen to.  Wondering if the problem was actually my computer, I switched to a little JBL Clip 3 that I have, and it worked flawlessly.  The Charge 4 was a total failure and is being returned to Best Buy.",89,5.0,2020,07,July,28
Wonderful speaker,2,"Love it, I been use it at the pool, riding my motorcycle, for bbq, connected for mo it’s outdoor of my patio... love it!!The only cons is the JBL app, no equalizer, option to add play list... the app is useless.But the espeaker it’s amazing, waterproof!!!

Portable Speaker,2,Worth all the praise and the moneyEdit:  battery does now,10,5.0,2020,07,July,25
The Charge 3 is a better choice,7,"I'm in a small space so this thing is REALLY loud which is great. Lots of bass, also great. Not so much if you're looking for quality highs and such. I'm really happy about this purchase. Unless you're a music sound quality critic you'll be happy too.",47,1.0,2020,07,July,24

TERRIBLE HARDWARE!!! DO NOT BUY!! Waste of money,8,"I am so happy with this purchase. I can't believe what a great sounding portable speaker this is. I love this speaker so much that I even just got a case to protect it. Not that it needs, but it's built like a tank. And the other great thing is that it can even charge your phone if you need to. But man; awesome sound! I think it's a good price for it.",73,1.0,2020,07,July,22

No charger provided,3,This is a very good little system for the price holds a charge for a long time and sounds really good at reasonable volume,24,4.0,2020,07,July,22
Cleanest bass under $200,4,"I bought a ""like new"" speaker, but before I made my purchase, I contacted the seller and basically asked why the product was classified as ""like new."" Their response: ""Item is inspected and 100% functional. There's a 30 day return period."" I took a chance; the only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is because my speaker arrived VERY POORLY PACKED; I consider myself lucky the speaker is of such superior quality/durability, because delivery people don't make a habit of handling packages carefully, and the ""protection"" provided amounted to some shredded foam (from an original box) thrown-in a regular shipping box with the packing bubble wrap. EVERYTHING had shifted in shipping; there was no effort to secure the bits of packing material to protect the unit. And, it arrived with NO user manual or operating instructions of any kind. I had to go on YouTube for a tutorial, and to JBL's site for a manual download. So, 5-stars for the product itself; actually, I'd give the shipper 3 stars, but I don't want the overall rating to reflect poorly on the product itself. JBL is THE TRUTH!",188,5.0,2020,07,July,21
Great product,2,powerful speaker great sound,4,5.0,2020,07,July,21
Horrible Experience,2,Doesn’t hold a charge. Lasted however long the battery was charged for initially and that was it.,17,1.0,2020,07,July,21
Very good sounding bt speaker,5,I LITERALLY just pulled this speaker out of the box. Turned it on and paired it to my iPhone. Sounded amazing then I went to charge it and it turned off and it won’t turn on at all. Tried all the troubleshooting steps and it’s still dead. WHAT THE HELL???,50,5.0,2020,07,July,21
Excellent,1,"I bought this speaker 2 days ago from this comment date, I used it with its initial charge worked well. Then I tried to charge it it never charged. I saw many similar problems about this speaker on reviews, some faced this issue after a month and they can't return it.I'm happy that it happened within 2 days.Won't trust this brand anymore.",62,5.0,2020,07,July,21
Sound is the best,4,"In my opinion, if you dive too deep into YouTube reviews regarding decibel comparisons etc. etc. you'll never end up buying any speaker...  Keeping it simple; I can tell you this is an awesome portable speaker for it's price range.  I take it to the community pool, BBQ's, outdoor family events and it's perfect!  Long lasting battery, good bluetooth connectivity and packs a pretty good punch in both volume and bass.  I would maybe consider the larger JBL Xtreme 2 if it goes on sale, but in all honesty this Charge 4 is perfect for what I use it for.  Portability to me is more important that a little higher volume and bass.  Love the speaker!  Well done JBL.",119,5.0,2020,07,July,20
Great Speaker,2,I’ve had my speaker for about 3 months now. The cord got really messed up and stopped charging the speaker and it would take 2 days to get it to 2 of the charging bubbles fully.I had it charging the whole day and it only got to 1 bubble icon fully.,51,5.0,2020,07,July,20

Great speaker,2,Great,1,5.0,2020,07,July,20
Excellent sound,2,I am not impressed which is odd because I’ve owned a few JBL products and they have been nothing shy of amazing. I have 2 JBL 3rd generation now that have far better sounds quality than the 4th gen. It won’t stay connected to blue tooth when the 3’s never have that problem. There is a feature with JBL that allows you to hook up to 100 JBLs together. Guess who’s won’t stay connected? Mine!!!! It’s so annoying and I put in a return for the item but got very sick and now can’t return it at all. In my opinion it’s a waste of money. You are better off get something else.,113,5.0,2020,07,July,20
Best portable speaker I’ve ever owned!,6,We use this on the boat and the beach.  Brother has one too and they will connect wirelessly with no problem.  Waterproof but will not float without an extra buoy.,30,5.0,2020,07,July,19

Awesome Speaker!,2,"Always loved these speakers and always will. This one you're paying for more vocals than bass, still maginifico!  Only problem was my connectivity issues.  When I first got this speaker, I could walk through my house with no problems.  Now, 5 months later I cant go 10 steps (literally) out of range from the speaker without it skipping.  Overall still a great speaker",63,5.0,2020,07,July,18
Love JBL,2,Can't pair any device because the Bluetooth button is not working.,11,5.0,2020,07,July,18
Good sound  and bass,4,"This is a great speaker with great battery life, and great Bluetooth connectivity to our Samsung S10 and a Chromebook. And the JBL app does firmware updates over Bluetooth. Love it.The reason for losing one star is its charging behavior. I bought this to have it in one location, constantly connected to a charger and to only carry it around from time to time running on battery. For some reason, the speaker charges fully, the 5 LEDs indicating the battery level go out to indicate that it's fully charged, but then after some time, the LEDs turn on again and the 5th LED starts blinking to indicate that it's charging, and stays that way. All this while the speaker sits there connected to the charger without being turned on. The LEDs are very bright, which makes it more annoying.",139,4.0,2020,07,July,17
Definitely worth the money,4,Love it,2,5.0,2020,07,July,17

Great product great quality great sound,6,"I got the Vifa Reykjavik and although I would say at the mid level, the sound quality is identical: clear, bold, and good bass, this JBL blows the competition out of the park at the higher volume settings. No distortion or loss in quality. The speaker is built well and looks great, too. Worth the money, I think.",58,5.0,2020,07,July,15
Portable and long battery life,5,"I generally don’t give five stars unless it’s something I extremely love. But this little bar of sound is totally awesome, amazing, extremely worth the money! This tiny little Bluetooth speaker is amazing. It’s super small but the sound is pretty loud. It’s very portable and you don’t have to constantly be charging it even at max volume. We have two big Sony speakers that can light up a party. They’re also wireless, but they’re extremely heavy and take up a lot of space and they are way too loud for public reunions. So we decided to get this JBL portable speaker and it was the best thing we did. It’s portable because we could take it camping, to the beach or pool or lake and the sound is great! And even if you drop it in water or juice it continues to work amazingly!",145,5.0,2020,07,July,15
Excellent sound quality,3,Bought for my son as a present. It fit the bill and was actually more than he expected. Did price comparison and it beat the competition hands down.,28,5.0,2020,07,July,14
Speaker,1,The speaker skips so much that you can’t listen to the music. Extremely frustrating. I am a major JBL fan so this is heartbreaking!,24,5.0,2020,07,July,14
Excellent speakers - especially for active living!,7,"I love it!! I bought this for my mom because I already have one of this brand so I know it has a really good sound quality. The battery lasts for long and you can be using it while charging and the quality still the same. Really easy to connect to your phone by the way, it only takes a few seconds. Hope you enjoy this product as much as we do.",72,5.0,2020,07,July,14
Battery Life is pathetic !!!!,5,"I use this guy all day every, literally. I work in remodel and I have it playing from 7:30-5:30 and then use it at the weekend to for grilling out, on the boat or riding my bike. Sound is great, good bass for a little guy and gets loud enough for what you'd need from a speaker this size. Easy to charge and last a long time, I only wish it would tell you when the battery was low with a noise and not just die on me.",88,2.0,2020,07,July,14
Damn Good Speaker,3,Last weekend I took this speaker on a floating trip down the river. I know it said it was waterproof but let me tell you..... our tube flipped over and the speaker was MIA. 45mins later we found it floating down the river.

Easy to connect,3,DOES NOT PAIR WELL AT ALL WITH JBL CONNECT.I bought this to connect to my jbl boombox. It paired and did the whole JBL CONNECT. WHICH JBL SPECIFICALLY OFFERS. It worked for about a month then started having problems. Connection was lost in a minute. Distortion. I even had them just a foot apart and still dissapointing. Buy it for solo use.

Would buy every color for gifts,6,"Loud and clear outdoors up to 150' away but don't expect a lot of bass. Its there but not deep.

Awesome,1,First off I would like to say I love this speaker. It's sounds amazing for the price. And battery life is very good..sit has a 1 year warranty to which I had to use on my first one and have no complaints. The battery quit charging so I looked up the warranty and email them had no problems getting it replaced. So my gripe is with the battery longevity life. I use mine everyday where I work and I'm getting about 3 years out of this product. But what do I know I'm not a battery expert. So for the price of this ..you can't go wrong.,107,5.0,2020,07,July,07

Quality Portable Sound,3,"My Granddaughter and I picked this out for her 20th birthday.  She wanted simple, great sound, to use at college and didn't want to be afraid to take it to a beach.  This speaker provides all of that.  Bluetooth pairing of her iphone with the speaker was simple and quick.  The speaker's sound is incredible and doesn't disappoint even when the volume is at the highest level.  Already took the speaker to the beach without a worry about water or sand.  There is 1 charging port on the speaker to charge a cell phone.  One comment on color.  The color Pink comes in many shades, and we weren't too sure where this Pink would land on the spectrum; however, the color is beautiful.  It's a soft shade, kind of a ""powder pink"", and even nicer than its picture!!",138,5.0,2020,07,July,06

Best speaker I have had thus far,7,"I use it for my iPhone, Toshiba TV, & my projector so I can have movie night outside but I haven’t hooked it up yet to my projector so far it’s worked great with my TV and iPhone. 👍👍",39,5.0,2020,07,July,05
Amazing,1,"We have the JBL Flip 4 and the Charge 4 that are able to sync together and provide coverage over the whole apartment, so that we can listen to the same thing in the kitchen, in the study, in the living room, in the bathroom or on the deck. Syncing is easy and intuitive, volume control on the secondary speakers is controlled individually, and you can ""pause"" them without interrupting anyone else's listening. Or, we can individually Bluetooth to a speaker, and listen to different things. Or, we use the speakers to amplify laptop sounds.These are perfect, simple to use, and easy to understand. We are so happy with them!!",110,5.0,2020,07,July,05
"Initially, connecting to laptop difficult but I learned how to change settings.",12,Live this speaker! Got it brand new for $130 and has great sound. Live that I can charge phone on it too.,22,4.0,2020,07,July,05

"Waterproof vs water resistant is as accurate as those who are still typing ""could of"".",15,Great speaker,2,1.0,2020,07,July,04
Great sounding speaker,3,Sound is very good for a single speaker with excellent bass response. An adjustable EQ vis phone app would be nice but still sounds great. Where this thing shines is battery life. I’ve had it for a few months and am still working on the first chafe and I use this speaker daily.,53,3.0,2020,07,July,04
2 brand new speakers didn’t charge,6,"Love our new speaker but 2 downsides. It’s not as loud as we figured it would be. Good sound indoors but not nearly loud enough outdoors. Also, sometimes it connects to a phone first try, but other times it takes much longer and is very hard to connect (same with pairing it to another JBL speaker).",56,1.0,2020,07,July,04

Sounds Great,2,"I realized I was spending more money on cheaper, less effective speakers. Finally invested in a JBL, honestly I don't regret the $$ cost. Its by far the best speaker I've ever owned. I bike a lot and love to use hammocks at the beach I always have it hanging on a strap. you can hear it from a long distance in a loud environment. DO IT! PURCHASE it!",69,5.0,2020,06,June,23
Amazing little speaker!,3,"Like that this product is waterproof & camouflage, that’s about it. The JBL Charge 3 is a better product I thought the 4 would be an upgrade but in my experience in less than a year the speaker now won’t hold a charge. My Charge 3 I had had excellent sound & long battery life & only crocked because the charge port became loose after years of hefty use. Very displeased by the fact I have to constantly charge the 4 & the sound quality doesn’t seem better either. I’ve only used the charger the 4 came with too & with the 3 I was able to use the universal android which was handy.",114,5.0,2020,07,July,02
Would recommend,2,Love this in every way! I didn't expect it to be so clear and have such nice bass. It holds a charge pretty much all day. It's perfect!,28,5.0,2020,07,July,01
"In Sum: Charge 3 is clearer and truer, Charge 4 is louder and ""bassier""",14,Love!! It came several days early and I am so pleased!! My only grievance is that it didn’t come with a charger box -_-,24,4.0,2020,07,July,01
Major Downgrade from the JBL Charge 3,7,Bought this to replace my 7 year old bose soundlink portable speaker.  The bose speaker seems like it has an overall better sound quality but battery life if far better on the jvc and the jvc is much louder.,39,1.0,2020,07,July,01

Amazing sound,2,Super speaker - love it!,5,5.0,2020,07,July,01
Highly recommend,2,"My husband has one, son two, and mom one. These are best quality ever. And are very versatile in that you can connect them all to each other or just use one or two. Highly recommended if you are looking for a portable speaker. You will not be disappointed.",49,5.0,2020,06,June,30
Lives Up To Its Claims,5,"This speaker is built so horribly. Ive had it less than a month and since the second it was delivered it was broken. The speaker will not turn at all unless its plugged in. Once on, none of the buttons work and you CANNOT turn the device off unless you hold the power button for a minute. And even then, it randomly makes noises. But then once its off again, you CANNOT turn it on unless plugged in. Eveything about it is broken and frustrating, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. and no they will not offer to fix/send a new one. TERRIBLE",102,5.0,2020,06,June,30
One of the best,4,"We should have saved our money spent on cheaper speakers, and just bought this first.  Great sound quality!",18,5.0,2020,06,June,30

Perfect,1,"Cleanest bass in the $100-$200 Bluetooth speaker out of 5 I tried. I tried the doss $80, Bose SoundLink 2, jbl flip 5, jbl charge 3, and megaboom 3. Out of all these, the jbl charge 4 had the cleanest bass and clearest vocals without distortion at large volumes.",49,4.0,2020,06,June,27
Disappointing,1,I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it.,13,1.0,2020,06,June,27
Amazing Speaker,2,"Where to start! I purchased this to use at an upcoming BBQ/pool party we were having with approximately 15 guest. When it first arrived I fully charged it (no wall charger included) connected to bluetooth, it was working fine for the short time I used it. The day of our party it would play for a short time and stop, but was showing it was connected to bluetooth. It was very frustrating having to stop what we were doing to try to figure out the cause, never figured it out. The sound quality was subpar, lacked in bass, and at times distorted. The overall sound was mono, not what you would expect for the price and an upgraded model. Also, you will not receive any of your phone notifications when using the speaker, so you need to keep your phone with you. We ended up having to use an old bose speaker so our guest would have continuous music without the constant interruption. Would not recommend the charge 4! A couple of our friends own the charge 3 and it sounds and preforms much better than the 4. Returned",189,5.0,2020,06,June,27
On the fence with this one.,6,"So far, a great sounding speaker. Very well balanced sound, most of the middle that comes out of it is crisp and clear. Good, punchy bass. Clear treble. Well defined mix for most music styles.",35,3.0,2020,06,June,26

"Will be my only speaker, at home and remote.",9,Obsessed with this speaker. Great sound quality & volume level! Charges my iPhone fast and still maintains plenty of battery life! I’ve taken this speaker on a kayak and still works perfectly after getting wet and bumped around.,38,5.0,2020,06,June,24
Long lasting.,2,"So far this has been an impressive speaker. I use by the pool, in the garage, on patio. Anytime we want some music outside. The battery hasn’t dropped below two lights out of 5. I have used for up to 5 hours and recharged an iPhone 8 from 10% to 65% and still had three lights on. The time I got it to 2 lights when I had it playing close to 10 hours on and off outside. The bass is good when you are a short distance away and the volume moderately high. When you are right next to it, the bass response is a little odd with the bass expander or resonators sounding a little rubbery.  Once you get a a little distance it sounds great. Especially next to structures. It makes the bass sound better. Bluetooth range is fantastic. Easily 20-30 feet outdoors with no obstructions. Also the splash proof features makes it safe for the splash zone next to pool. In the garage it’s really good while working. BT connects within seconds. I recommend.",178,5.0,2020,06,June,23

One of the best buys on Amazon!,7,Love JBL products. This is a great speaker good size nice to look at very stable. Nice sound output,19,5.0,2020,06,June,20
I super love it!,4,The mid and high range is a bit lower than expected however the bass levels help compensate to deliver a good sound. This is fantastic for the back patio and beach.  Battery life span ha snot been fully tested but in uses has thus far drained my cell phone faster than the speaker. The port in back can help charge as well,62,5.0,2020,06,June,20
Can’t beat the Charge 4,5,Love it!!!,2,5.0,2020,06,June,20

JBL ROCKS!!!,2,"My husband and I purchased two of these speakers and are thrilled with them.  The sound quality is fantastic and when they say they are waterproof, you can believe it!  We took one of our speakers out on the boat with us and wouldn't you know it, a passing wake toppled it right into the water!  We had to turn the boat around to go grab out of the water and the speaker never lost sound nor suffered any damage whatsoever!  The entire time it was in the water (about 2-3 minutes), it never stopped playing the song as it was floating !  Although an unfortunate incident, the speakers held up, continue to operate, and needless to say, we highly recommend them!",122,5.0,2020,06,June,16
I love my JBL,4,I bought this item a few weeks ago and it was disappointing to find out the battery does not even last 30 min at full volume. But the worst part is that even if plugged to the charger the battery will die if speaker is in use which will cause for it to shut off.,55,5.0,2020,06,June,16
Waterproof and resistant,3,Was going back and forth trying to figure out which JBL speaker to purchase. Finally “settled” on the Charge 4 (because all the JBL products are great) and it has been the best purchase that I have made. The sound is great and it’s a very loud speaker for its size. Would recommend to anybody in the market for a travel speaker!,62,5.0,2020,06,June,16

Great Quality,2,"I've had this for a year. Just took it to the beach for a second time. Got it wet. Got sand on it. Works perfectly. It can bump as well but the mids aren't super clear if you care about that. My guess is most of you dont, but I do, so I took off a star. All together, this is a 5 star device and if you want to annoy your roommate or put it in a backpack and ride downtown with the volume all the way up you totally can and your phone will probably die first. unless you rode the bike. 5/5 would purchase again.",108,5.0,2020,06,June,15

Best portable wireless speaker,4,"2nd time is the charm.  1st one wouldn't turn on if not plugged in.  Even when plugged in, turned on and paired, no sound comes from it.  It was a paperweight.  I  requested a replacement and it works great.",39,5.0,2020,06,June,13

Weak,1,I'm not going to lie this is probably the most awesome portable speaker I have ever had in my Life.  The battery lasts like 20 hours and at links with other speakers which is awesome.  My only problem is I don't Li had it 2 months and it already stopped taking a charge.  This is my 2nd jbl speaker to do that.  So I don't know if it's just a product problem or what but if it wasn't for that I would have given this 10 out of 5 stars.,90,1.0,2020,06,June,13
only one speaker so it’s mono,6,"I bought my charge 4 May 24th, used it about 4 times and the speaker won't respond it won't turn off or play. Not worth it.",26,5.0,2020,06,June,13

WHY NOT HAVE 2,4,I researched a lot before buying this speaker and honeslty jbl did quite a spectacular job . The bass is satisfying ( even more than its rivals ) the distortion is not not present at all . The outdoor compatibility is too good to be true . Just be careful not to puncture a hoke in the side radiators (though its quite hard to ) .,66,5.0,2020,06,June,11

I didn’t receive a charger or the carrying case.,9,"I was on the fence about purchasing a portable speaker as I'm typically underwhelmed with the sound quality, but this I dig. Out of the box it was lacking a little, but after EQing with my phone it is punchy and exactly what I am looking for. Large enough to carry the tech needed to produce quality sound, small enough to carry around or even throw in my bicycle bag to listen while riding. Not much I can complain about here. If I save up the cash I might buy a second one to get stereo sound, but I haven't honestly missed it that much. Buy one!",107,5.0,2020,06,June,04

Love my purchase,3,"I have both of these speakers, and I like them both. Here's the long and short of it so you don't have to research a million reviews.The Charge 4 is larger, louder, and has more bass. I like this one because I don't care about the miniscule differences in quality of mid/high/low that won't be noticed anyways since this is a speaker for pools, parties, etc.The Charge 3 is smaller, less expensive, and has a ""truer"" sound where the quality comes across as slightly, but noticeably, higher. It's not as loud and doesn't have as much bass as the Charge 4, which sounds noticeably less authentic than the Charge 3.Unless you're a tech guy, the deal with drivers, mono vs. stereo, etc. doesn't matter all that much.Do you want a louder, bassier speaker that can be heard from a further distance, on a bike ride, around a campfire, etc.? Get the Charge 4Do you want a truer, more authentic sound at a lesser price? Get the Charge 3.",168,5.0,2020,05,May,26
Perfect gift,2,Great sound. Take anywhere weather proof.,6,5.0,2020,02,February,05
🔥🔥🔥,1,"I originally gave this product only 2 Stars due to difficult Bluetooth connection with my laptop. There's a learning curve. I figured out how to change settings and am now using it regularly.I like it. I use it in the backyard in a remote area without cell service or internet.*end of changed review*My music collection is largely on my HP laptop. iTunes does not interface with BlueStacks. So I can't use the speaker for all my music.JBL Connect uses a new Bluetooth that requires Location Access.I bought the Charge 4 to use on a wooded property that I build Mountain Bike trails upon. There is no cell service in the woods.I can't interface with iTunes.I can't use this product without internet if I want to use JBL Connect with the new ""BLE"" (which I was not familiar with prior to purchasing).This is clearly an urban, Android related, cell service or internet service reliant device. It's worthless to me because of my unique desire to go use it outdoors without these services.I imagine it's great for streaming services but I'm extremely disappointed with its limitations.Other people have left very bad reviews for the JBL Connect app.Nice idea that will probably work well with your cell phone in an urban setting but then I've plenty of other options when I'm not outdoors.The product is both under thought and over thought and I find myself in the middle with a very limited functionality.",240,5.0,2020,06,June,02

Very happy,2,It exceeded my expectation. We love it and could practically take it with us whenever we travel..,17,5.0,2020,05,May,30
Perfect,1,The volume output of this speaker is disappointing.  Even at max volume it seems quiet.,15,5.0,2020,05,May,30
Love it,2,It didn’t work for more than 5 minutes after I tooo it out the box.,15,5.0,2020,05,May,30
totally worth the buy,4,1 star just for the misleading title.Maybe the public is too ignorant to realize that waterproof and water resistant are not even the same discussion.,25,5.0,2020,05,May,30
Great product. Will not dissatisfy,5,"Update: May 2021 - The speaker started crackling and became unusable.  Fortunately it was still under warranty and JBL was very responsive in handling the return and repair.  I just hope it lasts!This is my second JBL Bluetooth speaker.  I also have the Charge 2+ which I am very happy with, however,  after 3 years, the battery no longer holds a charge.The Charge 4 has excellent sound quality at the high, mid and low ranges. I bought both the Charge4 and UE Megaboom 3 for comparison purposes.  No contest... JBL was the superior speaker for sound in my opinion.  The UE speaker wins for features as it comes with a great App that allows for a more customized sound and user experience.Sound quality is what I care about most so I kept the JBL and returned the UE.",138,5.0,2020,05,May,29
Great sound,2,"My brand new jbl doesn’t charge even once. A hard reset didn’t work, getting a new charging cable didn’t work either. I had it replaced for another one, and faced the same problem again. Not worth replacing again especially given the unreliability of the battery. I’ll probably get a Bose or Beats.",52,5.0,2020,05,May,29
Great Sound - High Quality,5,If you dont own any go with the charge 4 its super reliable sounds amazing the bass is incredible also last a long time even while charging your phone. Really impressed with the product. And yes its loud!😂,38,5.0,2020,05,May,29
Color,1,The sound quality is awesome!! Worth the money. Love it!!,10,5.0,2020,05,May,29
Sounds great!,2,This speaker sounded awesome until it didn’t.  Started turning off on its own.  Spent tons of hours troubleshooting.  Called the company and they couldn’t even find my device by serial number.  They were completely useless.  Offered me a 10% off coupon to buy another piece of crap speaker.  This speaker was a gift.  I will never purchase a JBL product.  There are too many other products on the market to deal with defective equipment and piss poor service.  Don’t believe me.... google reviews for JBL pulse.  Tons of issues. Buy another brand.,92,5.0,2020,05,May,29

Two stars because of problems linking speakers.,7,"Use the charger cable in edge of the box (inside thin black box that looks like a spacer). Do not use an Apple MacBook charger with its USB-C cable!  Does not charge when connected to Apple MacBook charger with its USB-C cable.Sound quality and volume are great.  This speaker does barely squeeze into my bicycle bag that mounts to the handbag on my bike.BUT, after I put the speaker, then I pack extra bubble wrap inside the bag, because the speaker to round, and tends to rotate while I ride my bicycle. When the speaker moves so the buttons are in the down position, and I hit a bump on the trail, then the speaker turns OFF.",117,2.0,2020,05,May,26

great speaker!,2,"I read A LOT of reviews across many sites as I was trying to select a portable bluetooth speaker for pool days in our back yard and also for our river camping trips.  The Charge 4 is waterproof so even better for our two primary uses.I was originally going to go with Ultimate Ears Megaboom speaker until I read about the JBL Charge products and I'm so glad I did.I'm pretty particular about getting quality sound our of my home speakers, computer speakers and headphones and I'm very happy with what I hear from the JBL Charge 4.  For it's size the sounds is amazing and very ""full"" with good bass, but not overpoweringly so.If you have an Amazon Echo of Google smart speaker the sound from the Charge 4 blows those away.The Bluetooth syncing is super easy too.  If you've ever had bluetooth syncing issues with other devices you know the irritation I'm talking about that comes from that.  The Charge 4 sync'd to 3 of our phones with ease.Definitely worth your consideration if you're looking for a portable bluetooth speaker.",182,5.0,2020,05,May,26

Great speaker,2,"Solid speaker, and sounds fantastic, but doesn't sound all that far off from the great sound of its predecessor. Only upgraded only because I had thought the sound would be improved by a considerable margin. Waterproof feature was also a big reason why I needed one, as this sounds incredible in pool scenarios. Asides form that, not upset that I bought this speaker.",63,5.0,2020,05,May,07
JBL good choice.,3,"Several years ago, I purchased a pair of JBL Charge 3 speakers to use around our pool and was immediately in love.  I would connect one to my phone and then link the pair and have nice even sound all across our pool.  The range was great, the sound was great, and the batteries lasted a long time.  We eventually wore the batteries out and decided to replace them with a pair of JBLs latest ""Charge"" speakers, the Charge 4.  The sound quality and other features are the same, but the instability and sensitivity of the bluetooth connection and ""link"" feature are so bad, they are unusable.  I have to have my phone within 6 feed of the speaker for the bluetooth to connect, and they constantly cut out, loose their connection to each other, or pick up static.  It is so persistent, we are not using them anymore.  I deeply regret buying these speakers and wish I would have spent less money to but the far superior Charge 3 speakers again.  If you plan to connect two or more speakers together, stay away from these because they just don't work.",191,5.0,2020,05,May,25
They just don't last,4,This is a great device. Easy to setup and use right out of the box. Excellent sound. I am using it outside as I work on a big construction project - makes the work go much easier!,37,1.0,2020,05,May,25
good for now.,3,"Great speaker, provides good sound and lasts a long time. The reason for the star deduction is because the battery didn’t last as long as advertised. I took it on a float trip and it died about  8 hours in. Granted I had it turned up max the entire time and it was a hot day but I think it should have lasted longer. Also the sound on the float wasn’t as loud as I would have liked. It was incredibly sturdy and portable. No complaints there.",87,3.0,2020,05,May,25

Must have,2,The speaker sounds amazing it looks amazing I brought it to the beach the other day said it on the beach and went out into the water and could still hear it for quite a ways. My boyfriend has two that we have a Velcro mounted to our boat and honestly I think two is too many because it is super loud.But all around if you were looking for a small portable loudspeaker this is exactly what you’re looking for.,80,5.0,2020,05,May,24

It's great,2,"I have flip 4's and this charge 4. Ive played both and im a little disappointed with the charge 4, My flip 4 has stereo speakers and frankly sounds just as good if not even better then my charge 4. its weird. the flip 4 sounds amazing from low volume to almost highest volume. where the charge 4 doesn't sound as nice at low volume but will keep up at higher levels, almost pushing out about the same volume as its smaller sibling flip 4. the only thing i consider the charge 4 to have over the flip 4 is it doesn't get too distorted at max volume like the flip 4. but the flip 4 just sounds great almost at any level but at max, maybe a little less bass on the flip 4 too, but not by much. im beginning to regret my charge 4 purchase. i wish i just went with a new flip 5 and see how that works out.BTW i used the charge 4 for a hotel room Bluetooth soundbar. since i live in hotels while working each month. so good sound means a lot to me, especially when i get noise complaints from the host.",201,5.0,2020,05,May,21
Course I have concerns about it I portability sound quality water resistance this is the one to pick,18,"I’ve owned several speakers from several different brands but this is the best one yet. The sound quality is phenomenal for its size. The battery life is great, too. I took it out of the box on between 50-75% battery and played it for over 12 hours before it finally died.

I love this thing,4,"We purchased this product because we heard good things about it.  However, the battery stopped taking a charge after about 8 months.  We filed a warranty claim and after many emails and several hours of our time sorting things out we were told there was nothing they could do because the item was manufactured the prior year, and they do not go by the date of purchase- ridiculous.

Get it!,2,I rarely write reviews but this little bluetooth speaker from JBL is a gem. I've got a high end setup in the family room and picky about sound. It's hard to believe the depth and bass from this little guy. It actually projects a decent soundstage too. It's on my desk and improving the quality of my days at work. Crank it up between calls. Bluetooth connect is instant and battery life very long. I take it out when grilling and hanging the yard. Very portable and gets loud without distortion. How did JBL do this?,96,5.0,2020,05,May,12
Don’t buy it,3,"I bought 2 JBL speakers which had high reviews. Did not know I needed to install an APP to get them in stereo. ""Installed"" the app (confirmed by Google Play store and cant find it on my computer. Went to JBL video on Youtube for help and they want me to watch TWO video ads first?! No thank you. This is WAY too complicated.Update- I dont know how this product averages 5 stars. I have two units that I no longer use as I went back to wired speakers. aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh. Hear that? That is the sound of me no longer being frustrated by wireless speakers.The bluetooth lag is simply unacceptable. Once you figure how to pair the speakers in stereo then you have to press a button on each speaker every time you want stereo. There is only one active speaker in each unit. The battery on one of the units never fully charges. Takes a very long time to charge them.If you lived close to me then I would give them to you for free. I no longer want them.",181,1.0,2020,05,May,11
SO great! Highly recommend,4,One of the best speakers in the market right now.,10,5.0,2020,05,May,11
Don't count on that AUX input,6,It sounds a lot more boosted than most of the jbl’s .. fast shipment and definitely worth the money. It came well packaged and no damage from the looks and sound of it. Will update after a couple months to give its life durability and charging device,47,1.0,2020,05,May,11
Poor Sound Quality,3,"Update: downgrading from 2 stars to 1.  Jbl has terrible customer service at best.  If you have questions, no one will help.This comes with usb cord only.  Nothing to charge to wall outlet.  If you want to hear a text message sound notification through your speaker, forget it. The original jbl charge does allow message sound notifications.  You have to have your phone next to you constantly which totally defeats the purpose. It’s a step back. Will be returning this. Very disappointed.",82,1.0,2020,05,May,10
Great sound quality,3,i did so much research and ended up with this model and i could not be happier. the sound quality is amazing and it could get so loud. it could fill up the whole downstairs if i wanted. i got the white color and it looks so good.,48,5.0,2020,05,May,09
Sounds Great! Love it.,4,Agree with what other reviewers said about the flat mono tone of iteration 4.  Stick with the 3 version. I returned and went straight to the B*SE website and bucked up for the revolving sound. You get what you pay for!,41,5.0,2020,05,May,09
"Speaker 5, JBL application 0!",5,"The sound quality on this is wonderful. It is directional so it won't do 360° sound but music sounds beautiful with rich and full bass.

It is a little on the heavier side but still is portable enough to put in your backpack or  basket on your bike. Very satisfied!",78,4.0,2020,05,May,09

Does not turn on!!!!!,4,"I was debating between this speaker and the ultimate ears megaboom 3. My friend actually bought the UE megaboom 3 at the same time I bought the JBL charge 4. I can say this speaker has more bass and is louder in volume. I prefer the directional speakers on this (there is a front [where sound is clearer and louder] and a back).Don't love how there isn't a strap or loop or something to grip, but I did buy a REALLY cool silicone case (for $15) that has a strap and doesn't alter the sound.",95,1.0,2020,05,May,07

love this speaker,3,I would give it 10 stars ⭐ if I could. My husband loves it. Very loud and great for outside at the lake.

Awesome sound... and connects easily.,5,"Product was great. The only thing JBL could of did was add the power brick and not just the usb c cable.

The best,2, First of all the price of this speaker is cheap for the quality sound that your getting! This speaker sounds amazing! The build quality is great and the fact that is waterproof and you can charge your phone from it is an added bonus! So happy I got it! The only downside to me and this is just me being picky and annoying is that I can’t see the battery percentage on my iPhone but it does show it on the bottom of the speakers with little LED dots. GET THIS SPEAKER YOU WONT REGRET IT!!,96,5.0,2020,05,May,02
Worth it,2,Bought this speaker for my dad who is an expert in car audio and he was impressed in the quality and volume this speaker has.,25,5.0,2020,05,May,02
Make sure to add a charger nxtime,7,I like this speaker. Crisp clear sound with nice bass. The only misleading part for me was the 20 hr playtime. After 6 hours on moderate volume it was down to the 2nd to last light and it also says you can have something charging as well thru the USB.  I highly doubt I would have a lot of battery in doing so. Nothing different in battery longevity compared to my other non JBL speakers except a better sound.,79,3.0,2020,05,May,01

This was $100 more than the OontZ Angle BT speaker that I got three years ago and it's NOT better... at all.Holding down the BT button with the + button simply causes the speaker to unpair and power down.  These are not helpful.  Don't waste your money on this if you're looking for anything other that very poor bass.AND it overheats like a snowflake in the sun.

Valorie Wood,2,"Great sounding speaker. We use it at the beach so we needed a speaker that was loud enough to hear over the wind and the crashing waves. Plus, we can listen to it all day without having to recharge it.Love it.",41,1.0,2020,04,April,22
I don't know about this one,6,"AWESOME speaker that I plan on purchasing again for myself (the one I bought was for my girlfriend) but 20 hours battery life is a straight up lie. Did I mention the speaker sounds great, with a great Bluetooth range and controls. I love this thing so much. Also, my girlfriend probably doesn't know the best practices of maintaining a the longest battery life possible.",65,3.0,2020,04,April,22
Fantastic!!,1,"Meh. It’s a speaker. It’s a mono speaker and not an overly good one. 2/10 for bass, 4/10 for loudness. I think for $140 I should be getting something a bit awesome. I had an Anker $40 speaker that is similar in regards to output",45,5.0,2020,04,April,21

Broke within 3 weeks,4,This speaker has amazing sound and I love the fact that if you have multiple JBL speakers you can sync them all. A little heavier than I would have liked for a beach bag but no too heavy at all. I’ve already taken this speaker on three trips with me and it’s been a hit.,55,1.0,2020,04,April,14

Disappointing,1,"This speaker has been a nice upgrade from the standard 30-40 dollar speaker you can get anywhere. The sound is rich, and it does have good bass. I can why others stated some of the voice gets drowned out at times but enough to deter me from not buying this speaker. Overall the sound is great and can get decently loud. The color I got was SAND and it looks great. One thing that does not make sense to me is they dont give a power cord. I dont recall the last time I've spent this much on an electronic that didnt come with a accessory that is as important as that. All in all, I like it and very pleased with my purchase.",124,1.0,2020,04,April,09

Buy this!,2,Speaker sounds great battery last forever,6,5.0,2019,12,December,25
Awsome speaker..,2,"I have a small Bluetooth speaker and I was looking for one a bit bigger for an upcoming trip. I wanted something that could fill a living room and kitchen with some decent sound. I first bought the Soundcore Flare+ and while I liked the 360 sound and EQ settings on the app, it just didn’t fill the room with full sound. The JBL might be a bit narrower on the soundstage, the overall quality and low end were enough to seal the deal. I also like you can connect two devices at once. The Charge 4 has a nice heft to it and the construction is solid. Definitely feel like I got my money’s worth.PROS: Solid bass, Even sound, quality construction, connect two devices at once, battery life seems good, USB-C port for charging the speakerCONS: Soundstage a bit narrow, app has no EQ settings",146,5.0,2020,03,March,23

Awesome,1,"While the overall sound is decent for the price, I bought two speakers specifically for the ""Party"" feature, which is supposed to allow two or more of the same speakers to connect and play together. I've had nothing but problems with that feature. I've tried resetting per company instructions. I even sent them back and got two new speakers but the same problems exist. If you want one speaker, go right ahead, but I would advise against getting more than one.",81,5.0,2020,03,March,22
Overall great quality,3,"Whereas on the Charge 3 the bass gets a bit overwhelming, on the Charge 4 the bass feels non-existant by comparison. Further, sound on the Charge 4 is less clear than on the Charge 3, details in your music get off, faint notes disappear. Although the bass on the Charge 3 could be overwhelming, the overall sound quality was much better.Further, the Charge 4 is heavier, bulkier than the Charge 3 despite less functionality. On the Charge 3 I could make phone calls, but there is no calling ability on the Charge 4.If the Charge 3 upgraded its bluetooth to be better compatible with more modern devices, I would trash the Charge 4 and go back to the Charge 3.The only improvement on the Charge 4 over the Charge 3 is that the power button is a bit easier to press.",141,4.0,2020,03,March,22

Glad I got the deal... so good,7,"this is my fourth JBL speaker. My very first one was the little to go that lasted forever. I've had it for 5 years now and my daughter still uses it. My second one was a charge three it lasted a year and a half before the battery stopped working, my second charge three year and a half as well battery stopped working now I just ordered a charge four I've had it for a little over a week now and it glitches. It's staticky and it's horrible. I don't I will ever buy another JBL. I am very disappointed with the charge 4!Edit: I've had it a couple weeks and the battery only stays charged for 1 day. Do not waste your money!!",124,5.0,2020,03,March,21

Epic,1,"I have now purchased two JBL bluetooth speakers. I wrote to JBL about the first one not holding a charge for even half of the advertised time. I never heard back. My second purchase does not hold a charge for half the time advertised either :-(My JBL Flip 4 purchased from Amazon in July 2018 have only ever held a 3–4 hour charge. It's supposed to hold a charge for 12 hours.I reluctantly purchased another one, but figured my Flip was a dud—I have friends that say their Charges hold charges for a long time: JBL Charge 4 from Amazon in April 2020. My Charge 4 only hold a charge for about 7 hours. It's supposed to hold a charge up to 20 hours.The fact that these speakers do not hold charger for as long as they are supposed defeats the purpose. I can't use them on trips or in the woods like I should be able to as they need to be charged frequently.I bring my charge outside when I garden and it dies before my day is over and I have to connect it to a power source.I was wondering why my Charge 4 didn't sound as good or was as loud as some I had heard before and now I realize it's because it's not built the same as the Charge 3.",225,5.0,2020,03,March,10
Great product for the price !,6,"Great sound and size, my Grandson trying to steal mine so I just ordered him one for his birthday:)",19,5.0,2020,03,March,10

Sound,1,The smaller flip 4 is not only louder but sounds better due to 2 speakers instead of the mono speaker in the charge 4,24,5.0,2020,01,January,26
Love my new speaker!,4,"I got this speaker to ""upgrade"" from my old UE boom 2. Well, I would say the only things it does better is battery life and a little more volume. When you turn the jbl up to higher volumes while at work you can hear the low end effecting the highs and the speaker is very directional so it very difficult to find a location for the speaker that doesn't turn it into a shrill little squeak box. The ue I have is a much smaller speaker but it has nearly 360 degrees of speakers so it sounds really great from all angles. All in all the jbl definitely wasn't worth the money. I'm sticking with UE.",117,5.0,2020,03,March,09
Works great!,2,This thing is loud and sounds awesome! I had the jbl 2 version of this and one day it just got really quite. I have only used the jbl 4 once but I love the sound and volume. I will probably use it over the stereo system in my boat which is pretty nice because this thing sounds so good.,60,5.0,2020,03,March,09

Great for the money,4,"I was tired of buying little cheap speakers that weren't worth the money, didn't last very long and had terrible sound.  So, I decided to spend a lot more for a quality speaker.  I got this for use by the pool.  It linked very easily to my phone.  The sound is great with plenty of bass.  I can use it for several hours a few days in a row without worrying about the battery running down.  It seems to charge back up fairly fast too.  So glad I spent the money on this, totally pleased with my purchase.",98,5.0,2020,03,March,06
good speaker,2,"I originally heard this thing at Christmas (someone else got one as a gift)... Listening to them test it out, it put out some amazing sound from such a small device. It does sound great... But there are technical glitches that are really irritating...The first second of sound cuts out until it ""wakes up"" from its bluetooth soft-sleep-like-state (i'm guessing it's to save battery life)... It's supposed to have an app to tailor all kinds of controls, but after installing it, it refused to recognize the speaker no matter what I did. (It paired fine, I can play music to it from my phone, but communication with the app? Nope.)A little bit of user-oriented testing would've gone a long way here.",121,5.0,2020,03,March,06

Awesome product,2,I had different models was time for new one since going out town. Ship was fast but the thing would not stay connected to any phone for music or call. Sent back and had to go purchase from store and pay little more. But no issues and sounds great. Sent back got refund for broken one.

AWESOME,1,Amazing sound. I play it from the kitchen and can hear it in the bathroom. Light weight. very portable,19,5.0,2020,01,January,07
Good speaker,2,"I purchased this speaker over other portable options specifically because it had an AUX input. When using this input, the speaker has the brilliant design of shutting off when the signal falls below a certain threshold. This threshold is very high, and the the shut off happens basically immediately. The result is a continuous stuttering of whatever you're listening to, which is absolutely unbearable.Searching online, many people experience this. Some are able to solve it by cranking up the volume all the way up. This didn't work for me. Apparently you can remove a resistor on the circuit board to disable this built in ""feature"", but I just returned my unit instead. JBL was useless when it came to customer support. I won't be purchasing any products from them in the future, and I don't recommend you do either.",139,5.0,2020,02,February,27
Not too big not too small !,7,"After having the JBL Flip 4 for several years and loving it, I decided to upgrade and purchase the JBL Charge 4. I bought it new and once it came in tested it out. However, the sound quality was extremely distorted and sounded like the speaker was already blown because the bass was so scratchy even at 25% volume. I am not sure if this is an issue with the JBL Charge 4 or the individual speaker I received. Either way I will be returning this product and am very disappointed.",91,5.0,2020,02,February,26

good sound quality,3,Love it! Have had many portable speakers knowing full well that portability would sacrifice sound quality. Not so with my JBL Charge 4. Great sound! So easy to connect. Works great in the yard and on my boat. Got a great deal on it as well. Definitely would like to try out the Connect+ feature when I pick up another one.,61,4.0,2020,02,February,26
Yes,1,"The speaker connected to my phone right away. However, it was very difficult to connect it to Alexa and it didn't work very smoothly.... I had to go into the app to reconnect every time I wanted to use it! The main problem, however, is that it wouldn't connect at all to the JBL app! I contacted customer service and they suggested resetting the speaker and explained how to do this. I followed the directions and the speaker behaved exactly as they said it would and then turned off! Success!! Except, not so much. Now the speaker won't turn on at all!! I'm hoping this is just a defective device and when I return it and receive my new one it will work much better. If so, I will rate it again in a more positive light.Added note: I once again was able to contact JBL customer service and they got the device working again! It works perfectly, except it still won't connect to the JBL app! After reading reviews of the app, this is clearly a failure of the app, not the speaker! I love the speaker! I gave a4 instead of 5 only because of the problem with the JBL app!",203,5.0,2020,02,February,26

Good,1,"I've had this speaker for less than a year and have, for the most part, absolutely loved it! I use it in my car for long road trips and when the speakers in my laptop blew out, I started using it every day for podcasts, etc from my laptop. Unfortunately, the battery is just not holding a charge. It flashes red (indicating low battery) and then reads fully charged when I plug it in -- after less than a minute. Totally inaccurate, as it reverts to flashing red again in about 10 minutes.Very frustrating. And ridiculously hard to change the battery myself (I don't own the right tools), so I'm now in the market for a new speaker.",118,5.0,2020,02,February,17
Good,1,"Positives: Excellent speaker for portability and battery life.  Great for worry free music at the beach or around a pool and they are loud.  Great looking speakers that are small and very portable. Negatives: sound lacks quality.  If you just want loud good sound this speaker will make u happy.  If you’re looking for quality, you will need to step it up to a bigger JBL or a different product.",70,5.0,2020,02,February,16
Amazing,1,"Finally decided to buy a portable speaker and I'm not disappointed with my decision. First time playing impressed me.Update: after using the speaker for some time, it's not the best. Would I recommend? Depends on the purpose. The BT range is pretty incredible. It gets the job done for being portable. Like others stated, it's mono with the two woofers. Battery seems to drain on me a little quicker so I make sure I keep it charged after or during use.",81,5.0,2020,02,February,16
The best,2,Great speaker I’m just butt hurt that they advertise a yellow speaker when in reality it’s like ugly faded goldish. Just a head up for people who want yellow.,29,5.0,2020,02,February,16
Amazing,1,"I even bought a replacement plan and I still haven't gotten a new one. One day it was fine, then the next it just stopped working.",26,5.0,2020,02,February,16
Great for me,3,"Maybe this is just personal preference but the single offset speaker is very distracting. If you hold it in front of you, you can immediately notice that there’s no sound coming from the left side. I initially thought maybe mine was defective as why would such an expensive device be mono. I did more research and learned it was designed that way. The sound quality is still excellent, I just personally can’t look past the unequal sound distribution.",78,5.0,2020,02,February,16
Perfect gift !,3,Excellent!!,1,5.0,2020,02,February,15
Amazing!,1,"I got this for the bass, which delivers as promised.  It may be a mono speaker but It doesn’t sound like one - and you can always get a second and pair it.  Clear sound, plenty loud, amazing bass for its size.  Very happy w this product.",47,5.0,2020,02,February,14
Good Quality,2,"I bought a second speaker to have it in Stereo but I notice while having it that the other speaker cut off a few seconds. Other then that it feels like a brand new speaker. If I want true stereo I need to by a splitter and connect both as normal speakers for my laptop. Plus the syncing with Youtube is pretty bad with videos. It sounds clear and loud. Oh and one last thing about in stereo mode on and iphone it works with one app at a time so use it on Youtube for one day with the JBL Connect and then use it with Google Music another day when you sync the stereo mode with the audio app you that you want to use it. On Windows 10 its basically party mode and no real stereo mode. I did this with my laptop and one speaker sync in and the other sync in a a bit slower of 2 seconds to sync in. This is why I give it 4 stars but over rall I can charge my phone or use each one as a speaker louder then my phone, I cant use it as a Google or Alexa voice activator or even siri but as two speakers in stereo is good on IOS on my iphone 8 but cant do it 100% on Windows.",228,5.0,2020,02,February,14
Great speaker!,2,I had the jbl charge 2 and the Xtreme. The sound quality is equal to the charge 2 and didn’t sound any better at all. The style changed but other then that it did not impress.

The company offered me a 20% off coupon on the purchase of my next one but unfortunately it still came out more cost effective to buy a new one from Amazon! So I bought from Amazon.

Must have,2,"My wife and I spend a lot of time in the outdoors and were looking to upgrade out speaker. The most important things that we were looking for were: 1) sound quality 2) needed to be waterproof and 3) something that would be durable and last a long time. This speaker has certainly delivered on all of these things! One of the biggest complaints that I saw while during research was the mono speaker. There are some users out there that severely dislike this design and, honestly, it almost swayed me away from buying it. That said, I could not be happier with this speaker! Mono speaker works great, produces amazing sound (really loud) , and it truly is water proof - trust me, we've tested!I would definitely buy this speaker again!",132,5.0,2020,02,February,09

Affordable for what your getting,5,I assumed this speaker had bump and more than 1 speaker inside. Well I was wrong big time it’s 1 speaker on the right and it only gets loud with volume cranked all the way up. I had a aomias speaker that bumped louder and was for only $50. This speaker is overpriced for what it offers. Only goo thing Is the charge port is a usb-c which doesn’t break as easy as the standard android port.,77,5.0,2020,02,February,05

Worth the money!******update******It WAS worth the money until it just stopped working. So my husband only uses it to listen to music while he’s taking showers and it sits on the windowsill that’s three feet away from the shower so it doesn’t get wet and he regularly charges it. One day two weeks ago he tried to connect to it before a shower and it’s saying it’s connected but not playing anything. He’s let it charge, turned it in and off and it’s still not doing anything.I really thought this would be worth the money especially with how much he loved it but apparently they just stop working after two months.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE!

Great portable speaker!!,3,Thing sounds great until it shorts. Literally had the thing a month and it shorted out and will not work. Contacted JBL/Harmon and was essentially scoffed at. Since then I've replaced BOTH the battery and motherboard to no avail. I cannot remember the last time I wasted nearly $200 like this.,51,5.0,2020,01,January,19
Great Speaker,2,"Totally shocked at how clear sounding it is, it definitely gets loud.  I was very impressed with the life of battery.  However I now know why it last.  If you are not playing anything after awhile it automatically shuts itself off.  Kind of a nice feature.  We like it because of the Bluetooth and use it while driving in our RV. We have an older motorhome and it doesn’t have a fancy radio with GPS or Bluetooth so this portable speaker works great.  However using GPS Google Maps from phone is nice but while traveling it may only speak an hour later, well the speaker will shut itself off if nothing comes through in an hour.  So to fix that we just listen to SIRIUS via Bluetooth by phone and when Google GPS needs to give directions it just cuts through music to announce what ever.  So it works out great.",151,5.0,2020,01,January,19

Great colour,2,"I’ve had the speaker for about 2 and a half weeks and probably played 10 hours of music on it. I went to turn it on today and noticed the music was grainy sounding and lacked bass. At first I thought maybe I could be wrong that it didn’t sound as good as I thought. I went and checked others reviews and Charge 4 issues and many people are experiencing this issue. The JBL website warns about buying from unauthorized dealers and stated that counterfeit speakers have the exact same issue I’m experiencing. However, the JBL website lists Amazon as an authorized dealer which is where I got my Charge 4 so I guess I have an authentic speaker that now has turned into a piece of trash after barely any use.",132,5.0,2020,01,January,01

Family speaker,2,"This is my first speaker and I love it. I love the bass especially. I like to play my LoFi music at night when I’m doing homework and the sound quality makes the energy in the room feel so much more calm and relaxing. When I’m playing my regular jams on low, I can still hear the bass when I leave the room to go to the other side of the house and it sounds like there’s a party next door. Putting it in the bathtub while you shower makes the sound expand in a way so that makes for an exciting experience. This speaker is a 10/10.",108,5.0,2019,12,December,16

Great speaker,2,Beautiful speaker! I love the dark green color. The sound is crisp and clean. I just wish the volume would go just a tad higher but that’s not really an issue.,31,5.0,2019,12,December,15
Sound issues,2,Not thrilled with this. I returned a Bose BT speaker in exchange for this one. I bought this because I am having hearing issues but sound quality seems a bit “muddy” and fuzzy and didn’t realize until now that the sound is mono. Also the Bluetooth feature seems unstable in my room where I keep the WiFi modem and several other bt electronics. After some research I discovered this speaker won’t function with too much WiFi and bt interference. A bit frustrating. I’m probably going to return. It works well in every room in the house except the room where I need it the most. Tired of playing games every night to get  Bluetooth to work.,116,3.0,2019,12,December,15

Quality,1,"After hours of YouTube reviews, and a black friday cyber sale, I decided to go with this large awkward speaker with only decent battery life and ok sound quality. I know now for a fact that the bose is way better. The charge 4 distorts at about 3/4 of max volume and doesnt have the bass like that of smaller devices. Just because you add some flexy vibrating cones on the ends doesnt mean there will be better bass!!!!!!",79,2.0,2019,12,December,14

While the bass is the main star of the show, it leaves me a little disappointed that the treble and other minor but important rythms get drowned out a lot of the time. It could also be the music I play so I cant fault it too much. Overall, really glad I got what I paid for and a bit more as well",87,5.0,2019,11,November,22

Muy buena,2,"I've tried other JBL bluetooth speakers in past years. To be clear, I've tried many dozens, listened for hours, tested, usually reviewed, and I've kept the ones that I think have something special, good sound. I thought after a few more generations JBL may have figured out how to nail together a decent thing. I was wrong.Buy a Bose Soundlink Mini. Listen to it. Figure out how to do better than that. It has half the volume of this thing and sounds indisputably bigger, better.JBL, don't cry. Bose also completely beefed it with their own new-generation ""Revolve"" speakers. They had spectacular speakers in the Soundlink III and especially, the brilliant and nonpareil Soundlink Mini, and decided to make the awful Revolve speakers. They may get a notch louder, and sound like muddy garbage. But it's round, and that makes it better for parties. Congratulations, we've discovered Idiocracy. Sony is even worse leading the charge into irrelevance, starting with the SRS-X5 and ""improving"" it by making the SRS-XB40. Great bass for a speaker its size, if only great sound was produced by bass alone. It doesn't produce any midranges or treble. Speakers by idiots, for idiots.Anyway, JBL has never made a great bluetooth speaker, so I suppose a 4th generation speaker that still sucks isn't really giving anything up. I just want the world to know that this speaker just ain't great. There's better, richer, more articulate deep and mid bass in the Bose Soundlink Mini, at half the size. It's not waterproof, and I suppose, people who need speakers with round cabinets probably also need to listen to music around pools most of the time, and can't figure out any effective way to prevent their speakers from falling in, so... maybe the JBL is great.

Almost muffled sounding. The  low-end is decent for a device this size, but it depends on where  and how you position it. Against a wall or corner tends to resonate better and gives better bass. Placed on the floor does the same.And as others pointed out, this is a mono device.",74,5.0,2019,10,October,30

I love this speaker!,4,Love the sound quality really happy with this purchase. There’s enough evidence and reviews on YouTube to show how good these speakers are.,23,5.0,2019,10,October,28
Great speaker for the size.,5,"I had high expectations for the JBL Charge 4, because it has a lot of competition and gets good reviews. It's not exactly cheap, either. This implies that the Charge 4 should be, optimistically, almost as good as a Bose (for example). Unfortunately not.Call me sonically spoiled. I use Yamaha HS5 and HS8 monitors, on isolation stands, at home. My truck has a Bose system that delivers bass, mids, and highs like a reference system. I've heard plenty of Bose bluetooth speakers, and they've sounded good. I'm used to hearing everything, crisp and clear. Having said all of that, many people will hear this speaker and be blown away by the quality. It's not terrible, and it actually sounds good in stereo with two connected together. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Stereo mode is very unreliable and wonky.With a single Charge 4, the highs and mids sound pretty unappealing. The best word I can think of to describe its overall sound is ""flat and sloppy, with punchy bass."" The sound stage is disappointingly one-dimensional -- unless you buy a second one and use JBL's ""JBL Connect"" app to run them in stereo. Stereo Mode gives these Charge 4's an instant drastic improvement in sound, but my speakers switch out of Stereo Mode and into Party Mode (dual mono) every time I switch between apps, and sometimes just from hitting Pause for a second! This should have never made it past QA at JBL. I didn't know that was happening at first, but I did notice that things went from sounding great to sounding terrible, even with two connected. That's Party Mode. It's two copies of the same sounds, right on top of each other. I don't want that; I want Left and Right speakers that work reliably. Stereo Mode gives a wide stereo image, and somehow balances out the lone Charge 4's inadequacies a bit... But I can't even count on it to work properly.To summarize, I think the Charge 4 has potential to make a good-quality Bluetooth audio solution, but only if you plan on buying two and only if JBL improves Stereo Mode functionality right away. The app should remember which mode the speakers were on, and keep it that way... Or let us choose a default mode. Either would help tremendously.",384,4.0,2019,10,October,28

Love the speaker,3,"Plain and simple this is a good quality, loud and portable Bluetooth speaker.  I think if you want to get the job done the jbl line is it. In the year I've had it I've inspired a few friends to get their own after hearing and enjoying it.  I don't fuss with eq or other features because this is my portable ""party"" speaker and out the box it's tuned just fine for that.  If you want the best sound quality with stereo and more settings you should will probably need to spend more than what this is to get notable improvement.",101,5.0,2019,10,October,17

Love it!!,2,Awesome sound from a small package,6,5.0,2019,10,October,16
Love it!,2,I purchased one of these about 8 months ago for regular use. I found the sound quality to be very good. I owned an older JBL speaker that failed within 2 months. The warranty return was a hassle so I am pleased that this model has performed well. I prefer that tactile buttons as it makes it easier to find buttons in a dark situation as well as while driving. I also like the USB C connection. The older JBL with a micro USB port failed from wear and tear. I can no longer charge that one and repairing it is not cost effective. The only demerit I can say is this unit is a bit heavy to carry around and listen to music. It's more for placing in a static location. I do want to note the sound does tend to come from one side of the unit. It's not 360. It also isn't a stereo speaker; That means one driver with channels merged. Not important for me. The phone app allows for creating stereo sound from 2 individual units. I verified that. I purchased a 2nd unit during the holiday sale and would recommend this speaker to a good friend.,202,5.0,2019,10,October,14
Great sound!,2,Excellent battery life so far. Right out of the box with no charge it lasted 20 hours straight. Sound quality excellent. a little larger and heavier than I thought it would be.  Perfect for working in a kitchen but a little too big for my disc golf bag.,48,5.0,2019,10,October,13

Incompleto,1,"I returned the JBL Charge 4 for two reason. First, to my ears the sound has too much bottom. Music sounds muddy and the higher end is lost due to too much bass. Unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the bass and treble. What you hear is what you're stuck with. The second reason for my return is the awful electronic sound effects that play automatically when you turn the device on or off. Regardless of your streaming volume these sound effects are loud (and completely unnecessary).",87,1.0,2019,09,September,18
It’s a good product,4,Excellent speaker with great sound quality. Would 100% recommend to someone who is looking for a mid sized portable bluetooth speaker,21,4.0,2019,09,September,17
Liked Charge 3 better. Step back,6,Its nice to carry around as a portable charger that can play music. As for sound quality your better off purchasing the flip4 which outperforms the charge 4. The only upside I found was. That the charge was better and deep tones. Flip4 for the win,46,3.0,2019,09,September,17
Awesome!!!,1,Don’t get the white one.... it gets dirty fast.,9,5.0,2019,09,September,17
Works well,2,"Prior to this, I had a JBL flip for a few years before it finally died. I decided to go for this charge rather than another flip since I wanted a little more volume out in the garage. This Charge has surpassed my expectations. It’s significantly louder than the flip, but never loses clarity even at high volumes. The audio is clean, and bass is very good as well.The biggest surprise has been the battery life. I feel like the speaker gets used constantly, but it only needs to be recharged once a week or so.It’s also waterproof, which makes it super easy to clean.All in all I couldn’t be happier.",111,5.0,2019,09,September,17

The Best.,2,"I had an original JBL Flip for years. Recently the battery started dying so I decided to upgrade. I am so happy I did. This speaker sounds great, and is very loud, and crystal clear.The other upgrade is they went away from their own proprietary charger and now simply use a usb USB you can charge it anywhere even in a car. I love this change.This is a definite upgrade from the JBL Flip in sound production! It is also much larger though. If you are good with the size and are considering this speaker, do it!If I have any issues I will come back and update my review,  but if it's anything like my last JBL, you wont hear from me.",122,5.0,2019,09,September,10
This product is a winner,5,Upon opening  this speaker I noticed  it comes in very nice box. The speaker seems durable and sounds amazing ( when it works right ). I only had this for 3 days. I used it the 1st day worked great. Come the 3rd day not so much. It will play but cut out intermittently during songs. Speaker stays on it just literally stops when it wants to and plays when it wants to. I figure I got a lemon so I'll  try another. Might I suggest  don't  bother talking with support they will drive you insane. Just replace and move on.,101,5.0,2019,09,September,10
Your money is begging you to buy this.,8,"I would't be as bothered by the fact the Charge 4 switched to mono if they would've at least centered the damn speaker! Blows my mind. The majority of people that buy this will probably think the thing is broken because of that. No way I would pay full price for the Charge 4 when the 3 is stereo, much cheaper, and likely sounds better.",65,5.0,2019,09,September,10

Then gave it to him on his birthday and 3 weeks later it starts acting up and showing fully charged and only playing for an hour or 2 before dying. This item states that it plays for 20 hours when fully charged which is false. I call amazon and since it was a few days out of the 30 day period for a return I had to go to JBL for a manufacturer warranty. They send you a label and said it would take 14 days to determine if it is really defective for them to send a replacement. I am not at all happy with this product. Totally not worth the money. I have had my Bose soundlink for 3+ years and still sounds great and plays for a long time. Will not recommend this product.,152,4.0,2019,08,August,27
12 hours battery it’s a must,6,"JBL charge 4 produces the most awesome high quality sound from a portable Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard from, including larger speakers. You could jam to music or watch a movie with movie theater quality sound. Worth every penny.",40,5.0,2019,08,August,27

Good Speaker,2,"We use it for the workshop environment. Handymen, artisans, and similar workers often hear music or podcasts, and this is really useful when your only other option is using a phone speaker. However, it's still a small portable device and you can still look for something else if you're searching for the perfect audio experience. A home stereo is more suitable if you don't move around to much or if it's not a hassle to load and setup a home stereo every time you leave the workshop to work somewhere else. I'm very impressed with the sound coming from this liter sized device, and taking it on planes or road trips is really what makes it so good.",118,4.0,2019,08,August,26

Great all around sound,4,I lobe this speaker and truly lobe the sound and plan on getting another to complete a stereo sound.  No it does NOT gibe you stereo but sounds good.

Great sound.  Very loud.,4,Sound is excellent Don't know really about the battery life yet has made it through two golf outings for a total of 10 hours of music without being recharged but doubt it will last much longer on one charge at 3/4 volume...not a big fan of the base of the unit very small and rolls around easily,57,5.0,2019,08,August,24

The whole package!,3,This was my second purchase. I pared with another Charge 4 to get stereo.  Great sound. The bass could be deeper but it still is acceptable.Two issues are there is no user manual and no wall charger. So to pair two speakers I had to rely on YouTube to set it up. I also had to contact them to get wall charger specs. I'm using one that has a 5Volt/2Amp output.I play the speakers at a medium/loud volume. At best the battery is fairly depleted after 8 to 10 hours.It would be great if they offered a sub woofer.,99,5.0,2019,08,August,23

has great bass and sound for the size and price,10,"This was a bit bigger than I was anticipating but I'm not complaining. While that does affect portability slightly it's still very easily transported, especially with the case (sold separately but a worthwhile investment). It's loud and sounds great and the battery life is amazing! There's a bigger, better model for a little more money, but for my needs this works fantastic. I had some trouble with using it while camping, as it seemed to only be picking up mono: you could hear the background music and noises like doors slamming and whatnot but not the dialogue. I'm not sure if the problem was with the speaker, the transmitter, or the TV it was hooked up to. Hooking up Bluetooth headphones the sound was perfect, and hooking up this speaker to different devices the sound has also been perfect, so I don't know where the breakdown was.",147,5.0,2019,08,August,23

Obviously you can just max the volume on it and your phone, it gets distorted like anything else. For the price I pay this is absolutely worth it.  I use this mainly in the bathroom while showering since it beats phone music out of the water. I even carry it to the garage and place it and jam out while working on my car. Considering getting another one of these for a family member.",90,1.0,2019,08,August,21

Awesome product,2,I like my Charge 4 so much I just bought a 2nd one.  I keep one by my easy chair and one by my bed.  I unplug it and keep it near me when I do chores around the house or in the yard.  It sounds great and is easy to use.,52,5.0,2019,08,August,17

Excellent quality!,2,"I bought this because I wanted a portable speaker with an old-fashioned aux input. Unfortunately the aux input has a horrible flaw. If a couple seconds of silence go by in whatever you’re listening too, the speaker shuts off and only starts back up after it gets some signal again. You’ll lose about a half second of audio as it turns on again too. Like let’s say you’re listening to an album, a couple seconds of silence between tracks is enough to cause this and you’ll lose the first little bit of the folllowing song because it shuts off and then turns on again only after something loud enough to turn it back on again happens. So so annoying! After a little Internet sleuthing, I found out that this is just how they are. Apparently, you can fix it by shorting a chip on the motherboard, but I’m not doing that. Returning it. RIP JBL. Really dumb.",157,5.0,2019,08,August,16

Great sound,2,This device does play in stereo I’ve seen several reviews say that it doesn’t. But I can verify you will hear the various channels in the music. You won’t regret getting this just be very gentle with the cable that charges it and the plug ins. Don’t power jam the buttons. It doesn’t require an ape-like approach to use this speaker. When you press the power button there’s a delay. Lightly press and listen/feel for the button to click then just wait a few seconds. It will come to life. Battery life is awesome. I use it every day at the office for 8 hours and I charge it maybe twice a week. Good product. Yes it’s stereo. Anyone who says otherwise doesn’t have the ears and intelligence to know what stereo really is.,134,5.0,2019,08,August,03

Why spend so much money on Bose or these other brands..I was a bose fan for most my life..all my vehicles and sound systems in all my vehicles added the bose sound package..the only speaker I actually believe puts out better and louder sound quality for less than half the price.. let alone the battery life and the charging abilities..over 20 hrs of battery life and includes a power back built in to hook up your cell phone or even Alexa to play your tunes..

Good experience,2,"Great portable speaker. good sound, durable and not too expensive",10,4.0,2019,07,July,25
Great Speaker,2,"Initially, my preference was the Bose Soundlink Mini II with its smooth notes and decent sound quality in a small transportable package; that is, until I heard comparison against a JBL Charge 4 on YouTube. Based on that review and others, I purchased this speaker for its waterproof, multi-connect and sound.Great price:  You can buy a Charge 3 direct from JBL for $129 with 12 color options, with price point being on par with Amazon.Sounds great; EXCELLENT better describes it.  If you have a Charge 3 there isn't enough improvement to justify buying a Charge 4.  The Charge 4 went from two smaller speakers to one slightly larger speaker which improved bass frequency from 65Hz to a deeper 60Hz.  When the JBL arrived we conducted our own comparison against a  Bose Soundlink Mini II and - Wow.  The Charge 4 is much clearer, has better frequency response and has better sound presence in the room.  It's a bit larger and heavier than the Soundlink Mini II which might turn some off, but to me; if I'm going to carry any speaker like this then I'm taking the same care and am sure I can find just a little more room.Good packaging but NO INSTRUCTIONS?!  Not that charging and setup are all that difficult, but this is my first device that requires USB C, first anything that arrived with ZERO printed information, and rechargeable device that arrived with ZERO anything to charge it with.  ///  Setup was easy.  I bought a USB C cable from the nearest gas station and plugged it in for 3 hours since it came somewhat charged already.  Once charged, press the Bluetooth button then connect to your phone or other device.  For settings, I always recommend phone volume to be no more than 1/2 to 3/4 volume then using the Charge 4 volume from there. This affords you plenty of up/down volume adjustment remotely from your phone and doesn't task the internal sound processor....this, since it's cheaper to replace/repair a Charge 4 than an expensive smartphone.  You and someone else can be Bluetooth paired to this speaker at the same time.Battery Life:  The built-in rechargeable Li-ion 7500mAH battery is strong.  Not only does it support up to 20 hours of playtime (at lowest setting, and figure 10 hours at half volume), but it will also charge your phone and other devices via the USB port.  I strongly suggest buying a protective case for it which will hold your charger, USB C charging cable AND any spare USB cable needed for cell phones.It has the same IPX7 waterproof as a iPhone, Samsung or other higher end smartphone.  We place it on the deck without any worries of accidents from fluid spills, big splashes, being left in the rain, or even an accidental swim in the pool.  Having that peace of mind alone is priceless.JBL Connect+:  With Connect+ you can connect several of these to together for full sound experience.  Put 4 in opposing corners of a large room, in different rooms, indoor and outdoors...heck, even in your car if your current stereo or speakers are crap.Bottom line - this being my FIRST Bluetooth speaker ever, and having friends that have made different choices for the speakers they have, I have zero regrets with my purchase after hearing it beside theirs.  Bang for buck is spot on.  I have excellent sound in a transportable package in a wireless speaker that is rugged, waterproof and allows multiple speakers as well as people to connect.  I now proudly own the party favorite speaker for socials, events and private enjoyment.  WIN!",600,5.0,2019,07,July,25

Great sound and portability,4,For the size it’s got a nice punch to the bass but the high ends are slightly muffled,18,5.0,2019,07,July,22
Very nice,2,"Sound quality is absolutely great.  For its size it can really fill a space.  Sometimes I leave it playing in my room and go outside and it almost sounds like I have a whole mini hi-fi stereo system in there.  The bass is very good but can also be tremendous if you position it right.  Place it in a corner where it can bounce the sound off the walls etc and prepare to be amazed.  It's slightly bigger than the charge 3 but probably the price you pay for bigger sound.  It really hasn't affected the portability for me.  I just throw it in my backpack and go.  It's pretty durable, haven't dropped it but had paint droplets splash on it and was able to wipe it off with a damp cloth perfectly and also sand etc comes out of it easily after a day at the beach.  My only gripe is the single speaker that is contained in the housing is off to one side, so sometimes if you're right in front of the speaker, close enough to it you may hear a bias towards the left side.  Other than that, totally excellent speaker.  I never really charged my phone on it beyond a few minutes but it works, and the battery life feels super long, especially if you're not playing it constantly.  Honestly I'm just excited now waiting to see how JBL is going to improve on this in future models.",243,5.0,2019,07,July,22

High quality with excellent value,5,The difference between charge 3 and 4 was noticeable and the 4 is worth the extra $!,17,5.0,2019,07,July,13
Great value.,2,It's great all is good very good.,7,5.0,2019,07,July,12
It is good,3,Great sound. It's simplicity is it's key. It is meant to be an outdoor speaker and to fill up a wider area so don't listen to those who complain it's not stereo. Stereo is useless if it's speakers are so close together.It's not too big.The accessories you can buy are good. I like the rubber carry case and the hard case as well,63,5.0,2019,07,July,09
Pre-opened box (good speaker),4,i get annoyed with the small things that they cheap out on in speakers and really if i had to find something wrong with it it would be the that the outer edges are plastic and not rubber but they make cases for them so not too big of a deal,51,3.0,2019,06,June,27

worth the money,3,"The Charge 4 will connect with Boombox & other Charge 4s. Charge 3 will not connect to anything, so don't bother trying. I bought 2, 1 new & 1 renewed, neither connected. The connect button acting like the blue tooth button. JBL dropped ball on it & fixed it on Charge 4. UE Booms are best for connecting @ their $64 price. Sound quality is better than JBL, but JBL has better base response when you want to play speaker loud.",81,5.0,2019,07,July,08
Highly recommend,2,"On the pricey side, but well worth it for my needs. It’s great for filling the backyard with tunes & podcasts while gardening or playing with my two dogs.Pros: loud, clear sound; simple operation; excellent build quality; available in a variety of colors.Cons: could use an EQ in the app, or even a simple Low/Mid/Hi curve control to optimize it for different listening environments; can’t be powered On/Off remotely from app.Summary: we were sufficiently impressed with the Charge 4 that we bought a second unit for garage/basement use.",88,5.0,2019,07,July,08

They advertise that it connects to up to 100 other JBL speakers, but it isn’t true.  I have another JBL, which is why I purchased this one.  It 100% DOES NOT connect to my other JBL speaker.  I called customer service and they confirm that it will not connect to my other JBL speaker.  It is a complete bait and switch.  Poor, customer service and straight up lies on the part of JBL.",91,5.0,2019,07,July,06

Love it,2,"It is a good speaker, the sound quality is great, no complains about it, it feels really good built and the bass is great, but the volume... it is not as good as i thought would be (not bad at all) because of the speaker size, the batery time claims to be 20 hours of playtime  but i havent try for that long yet, but in general terms it is a good speaker",73,5.0,2019,07,July,03
Excellent purchase,2,Very Good Product,3,5.0,2019,07,July,03
It’s loud,2,"Unboxed this today and couldn't listen for more than an hour. Muted sound (no treble, just overloaded with bass). Removing the extra bass with the bluetooth/volume-reduction buttons combo to produce a flat sound didn't help. JBL/HK should invest in an EQ app asap to allow users increase the higher frequencies to produce their preferred output balance. I can even live with just preset EQ settings but not this. JBL didn't listen to all the Charge 3 criticisms about sound quality. Very disappointing. Packaging back up to return. Total waste of time",91,5.0,2019,07,July,01
Worst thing ever,3,"Rich sound, adequate bass and midrange. Its heavier the smaller portable sound devices I have owned, but I don't have to worry about battery life. We take this to the beach and will take it kayaking too.",37,1.0,2019,06,June,30

charge,1,"This portable speaker packs big sound in a small package. It offers truly great sound quality, easy/instant pairing to my iPhone, and a nice design aesthetic.

Perfect!,1,I mainly use it for music.Its Good.,7,5.0,2019,06,June,27
Good value for money,4, This speaker sounds great 👍Thumpy punchy and in certain instances has deep booming bass. Mids n highs are clear. Could be a little more crisp and of course have more bass but it is a full rich sound and using an EQ brings out more of its capabilities. JBL quality construction.I was on the fence about buying this because they went to a mono driver but you can't really tell a difference in fidelity. You can tell the bass is slightly deeper than the Charge 3. Completely happy with it and love the green color. 😉One thing i do not like is they took away the speaker phone. Put the speakerphone back. That's a thing I like and is missing on this. 🤨 As for connecting to older speakers with connect you can update the older speakers to connect plus to connect with the Charge 4.UPDATE: Liked it so much I got another one. 😁 Camo. These sound great. It actually has bass. 👍 No issues with connectivity or battery. This is the best speaker in this class or category. There are some that come close but these can't be beat. The price hike is a downer. Don't know what's going on there. $179? That's crazy. Got these for $99 and that's what they should be. Seems getting good reviews helps their sales and they take advantage by jacking up the price. 😐 Not cool. At $179 they aren't that great. I would expect more at that price.,248,4.0,2019,06,June,25
Great Speaker.,2,Great sounding speaker. Deep bass.,5,5.0,2019,06,June,25
...,1,"I was told that the speaker makes two sounds before playing audio from the other paired device. One for when it turns on via pressing the power button, and another for once it connects to a paired device. I got no sounds from either of actions.I turn the fully charged speaker on. From this point I am supposed to hear sound notifying that the device is on. All I see is the power button light, light up. I then press the bluetooth button, and that lights up too. Then I connect it to my phone (which has connected to other bluetooth devices perfectly fine). I get the notification on my phone that it is connected to the speaker, but no sounds from the speaker notifying that it is connected to the phone.I even reset the speaker, and it still gives no sound.Very disappointed, will be returning.",146,5.0,2019,06,June,23

Great Speaker,2,This is an amazing sounding speaker. It has good base but not overpowering. The sound is clear and deep. It is a mono speaker but can be paired with a second one for stereo. I use it at work and am rarely able to go past half way. At full volume with an iPhone 7 (not sure if it matters) it never distorts or sounds scratchy.,66,5.0,2019,06,June,20

Great Speaker,2,"I've been around music my entire life including spinning records at top nightclubs where JBL was the speaker of choice. I really wanted to love this speaker but it's not happening. JBL should be ashamed of themselves! The sound quality is horrible. The speaker clips at between 1/2 and 3/4 of the volume using my phone. At 1/2 way, the speaker / music coming out is missing everything including clarity, bass, treble & yes... Stereo. Everyone with reviews complaining about dead music coming out is absolutely correct. The speaker plays dead music especially at higher volumes. Anyone wanting a cheap portable speaker with horrible sound, this is for you. Anyone looking for a great speaker, this is not for you. Yes, you get what you pay for but with today's technology, every speaker should sound great! Take a look at the Marshall Bluetooth Speakers, they're amazing. Also, if you don't need portability, the Klipsch speakers are amazing. Sonos is overrated. I find myself always going back to the good old names from decades ago. Even the Bose Speaker selling for around $160, on sale right now at BB, sounds 100x better than these JBL Speakers. Folks, take a look at the Bose & Marshall BT Speakers. You'll really enjoy the sound especially from the Marshall Woburn II. I have the Bose Soundtouch 30, the speaker blows away every speaker on the market. I also had the Marshall Stanmore hooked up to my phone and computer, it rocked. If you can find the old Bose Acoustic Wave, in mint condition, that was once an amazing speaker too. Hope this review helps you. Thanks for reading it.",275,5.0,2019,06,June,18

Sound is bomb,3,"Thankfully I didn't buy this from Amazon. I bought it from Walmart. It sounded great, and JBL has always been a favorite brand. They had it for the same price as Amazon, so I took it home and opened it up. As Amazon states, it does not come with a charger, which is a problem because it does not charge with a standard USB charger plug. It also comes with no instructions or documentation. I returned it for a refund. Too bad, because it really does sound great for its size. I guess you really have to go to a big box store so you can hear it and check out how to charge it. I gave it 3 stars for battery life because I really can't judge battery life, since I never got to charge it and use it. I gave it a one star overall rating because if you can't charge it with a standard plug, it's useless.",160,5.0,2019,06,June,17

Sound Quality,2,"A lot of people were jumping on this speaker for the fact that it is a mono speaker and I just wanted to stand up for it. You can hardly tell the difference between the 3 and the 4 unless you stand very close. The two stereo speakers in the Charge 3 are just so close together it doesn't really matter and the difference is small. The sound quality is definitely improved however. The mid and highs are not muddy, like the 3's and the bass is slightly deeper, making a very enjoyable sound experience. The only gripe I'd have about it is that it cannot be a speakerphone or connect with Siri or Google Assistant, but that is minimal compared to the improvement of sound quality. If you have the 3, don't upgrade, it still isn't worth it. But if you are deciding between getting the 3 or the 4, get the 4.",154,5.0,2019,06,June,15
Quake and Bake,3,"Attached it to my bike for RAGBRAI. Works great. I like that its waterproof, has a long battery life, charges my phone if needed and syncs with other JBL speakers (within typical 30 ft bluetooth range).

Got a second one (4) this year so there is always an extra around.They take it from pool to porch to room to park and repeat. Plenty loud for those around it or around pool. Clear sound at volume and provides full sound even with higher bass music. A lot of bang for the form factor. Practical use is mulitdays-week on a charge so doesn't always need charging and doesn't strand you.Would buy again.",95,5.0,2019,06,June,12
Sounds is perfect,3,"+Sound+Battery life+Build quality-LED's too bright, don't time out+-They have a 'daisy chain' feature you can use, but it's been hit/miss with us.These speakers are fantastic for the price. We bought 2 of the Charge 4, and 1 Charge 3. The only reason these aren't 5-star for us, is that the primary use is in the bedroom to play sleep stories/music. The LEDs for buttons on top never time out while the speaker is turned on, and are SOOO bright in a dark room. Unfortunately, we have to drape something over the top of the speaker to hide the lights. 5 stars if that weren't an issue.As for battery life, I use one in my office all week for conference calls (with a desk mic), and charge it only every other week. Fantastic.",132,5.0,2019,06,June,12

"Comes with only the cord, not a full charger.",9,"This speaker works good enough for me. Unlike most I bought this because it was a directional speaker. I use it while welding in the shop and don't want everyone to have to listen to my music too. It stays 20-30' away from me and I can hear my music just fine. The battery will last all day (even at high volume) unless you try to charge your phone with it. I got 4hrs with my phone plugged in for half that time. Without using it to charge my phone, I got 10hrs out of it and it was only down one ""dot"" out of 5. Overall the sound is decent. Worth the money if you get it on sale.",120,1.0,2019,05,May,30

Better deals around black friday,5,"This has less sound outputand quality than a JBL flip 2! I'm extremely disappointed with this model.

Battery life,2,I bought this to play music to my daughters. They enjoy to listen to their favorite songs here. The sounds is of good quality and fills the entire living room in our home.

Great sound minus the lack of high tones,8,"I'm very surprised by this speaker.  I did a lot of research ahead of time and decided on this one as it's highly regarded.  I've heard several different BT speakers and none sounded this good, I'm extremely satisfied with the bass output.  It's best if used a few feet away from you as it sounds better.  Had it outside last night during a rainstorm, it was basically getting misted on for hours, but no ill effects.  You will not be dissatisfied.",81,5.0,2019,05,May,27

Bad bluetooth connection.,3,The JBL speaker is a very good high quality speaker.

Got it in 24hrs. That was fantastic,7,"Although I just yesterday ordered the JBL Charge 4 and so haven't received it yet, I did some research into how the device charges.On one end of the charging cable is the new (and better) type of USB connector (USB C), and on the other, the standard (well familiar) USB connector.The charging port on the speaker only accepts the new type of USB connector known as USB C, not the standard USB that we are well familiar with.HOWEVER, the unit comes supplied with a 2-sided cable that WILL plug into a standard USB port, such as on most or all home and office computers, and also (some) AC wall chargers. The speaker does NOT come with this necessary USB-accepting AC wall charger. So if you do not have one already, you'd have to buy one someplace. Otherwise, simply plug it into a USB port on a computer.The new type of USB connector (USB C) is better because it is the SAME all around. That is, you no longer need to worry if the jack is orientated properly before inserting. It'll work no matter which way you plug it in, a much convenient design over the old.I think, but am not sure, that it MIGHT also work faster than the old and familiar USB connector. However, at least as of now, there is still a standard USB connector on the other end of the cable. So perhaps the faster charging speeds, assuming I'm even correct on this, might only be the case when these cables have the new type of USB (USB C) connectors on BOTH ends. In any case, as is, it's still better than the standard USB because of not having to fumble around when attempting to plug it in.Not only is it annoying fumbling around with the old (standard) USB connectors, the fumbling can actually damage the insides of a USB port due to repeated attempts at trying to insert an improperly orientated connector. Like trying to force a square peg into a round hole, after a while, the inners of the port will get bent out of shape. However, this is much more of a problem with the standard MINI-USB connectors commonly used with mobile phones and many other small devices.",374,5.0,2019,05,May,15

Sleek design,2,"Update 7/10/19 - Definitely a noticeable sound differences between the 2 speakers.  The S model is flatter and doesn't get as loud as the J model, it also has a muffled sound to it.  So far I have received bad customer service from JBL.  The seller I bought from (Electronics Expo - an authorized dealer) has a 2 week return policy so I'm outside of that and thus far JBL won't even admit they are selling 2 different models to customers.  I sent pictures and even links to FCC filing pages and the customer service reps don't even acknowledge it.  They want me to do factory resets and firmware updates.  It's different hardware!!! All they offered me was some 30% coupon and told me to deal with the seller.  This is the last time I'll ever purchase a JBL product and surely will urge friends and family to steer clear of them as well.Original - (Pictures Included) Just so people are aware.  There are 2 different models of the actual speaker you may get with this.  It seems legitimate based on the FCC filings page, but I want people to understand in case they notice differences like I did when I put them side by side.  The model number on the box itself is the same (JBLCHARGE4BLKAM), but JBL is shipping 2 different speakers inside the box and not telling people.  There is a S model and a J model.  The boxes themselves are nearly identical besides the small QR code next to the serial number on the model S.  If you open the charging port flap and look on the left side next to the serial number, you will see which one you have.  Now if you only order one speaker, you'd probably never know, but if you order 2 of them and receive 2 different models, the differences are obvious.(CHARGE4S) The S looks to be the older model.  According to FCC filings this has a 7800mah battery inside.  From my personal observations the mesh on the outside is thicker and you cannot see through it at all.  It also feels a bit heavier in the hand.  I don't have a digital scale to measure exactly but it's definitely more dense.  The charging indicator lights are also much brighter (you can see this in the pictures).(CHARGE4J) The J seems to be the newer model.  This is the model that actually has a 7500mah battery inside.  The mesh is not as thick on this model and you can easily see the speaker components inside.  Also, the charging lights on this model are much dimmer compared to the S.  It feels a bit lighter in the hand as well.I haven't put them through the ringer yet to see if there are audio differences.  It would be very disappointing if there are.  So buyer beware.  JBL is selling 2 different speakers with different battery sizes that potentially sound different, but they are marketing it as the same product!  Wish I would have known this before I bought them.",506,5.0,2019,03,March,12

Solid product and sound,4,"UPDATE: after 1 year of not so actively using it, does not make any sound. We did not use it much, I had to charge battery once or twice in total. The last time battery died and after charging it, it does not make any sound at all. (I think it was a second time I had to charge) Other functions like bluetooth, light and +- buttons are working though.Tried to upgrade software by downloading and connecting mobile app, but no result  whatsoever.I am really disappointed about that, do not even know what to do keep it or get rid of it----------------------------------------------------------------------easy to use, descent sound quality and battery performance.Usability: bluetooth connection -easily discoverable, easily usable even for non-tech-at-all peopleSound Quality: Bass and high notes sound clear with very pleasant deep bass.Battery Performance: I do not know if that is a standard, but my one was decently charged right from the box and played for several hours non-stop without any additional charge. Battery charges fast and lasts as promised.P.s. will need special cover / holder for it to carry and keep safe&comfortablyWould highly recommend.",184,5.0,2019,02,February,28

Quality,1,"I purchased the JBL Charge 4 because of reviews.  I had also purchased a UE Megaboom (not the newer Megaboom3). The two were equally priced, so it came down to sound and features. The JBL allows for charging a device, and for using a plug-in direct jack instead of Bluetooth. I thought those were more important when I ordered it, until I listened to them side by side. I had 3 listeners and switched back and forth between them using same songs. The other 2 listeners liked the Megaboom better, but couldn't identify why. I found the Megaboom to have tighter bass, and much better transparent mids and highs. The Charge4 sounded muddy in lows/mids/highs in comparison. Alone it can sound okay, as long as you don't have competitive reference.  Sound quality beat out battery charging and the Aux input.",140,5.0,2019,02,February,20
Quality and durable product!,4,"As a woman in today’s society it is hard to find the time to clean and cook, but now having a speaker that plays my audio of choice, it definitely  helps to motivate those actions! Can’t wait to clean next Saturday!!!This is awesome it can go any where with you and is water resistant... hhello shower concerts!!**Simply hook up your Bluetooth device to the speaker and your ready!",68,5.0,2019,02,February,18
Awesome Sound,2,"I have purchased 2 of these for my kids.... now I ""borrow"" them all the time when sitting out by the pool or going to the beach. Great sound quality and very simple to set up. highly recommend.",38,5.0,2019,02,February,18

"If money isn't issue for you, you need to upgrade your mid size portable speaker to charge4 anyway.",18,"Was deciding between this and UE boom..went with the boom first..and it just didnt have that deep bass and sound i personally like..but this charge 4 does! Night and day on that..battery im not sure yet haven't ran it more than 5 hrs at a time, but so far no issues..glad i got this one",55,5.0,2019,02,February,14
No longer working after 30 some days...,7,Was looking for a speaker to blast out the neighbors who sit too close at the beach.  I think I found it in the jbl  charge 4.  Stay tuned....,29,1.0,2019,02,February,14
Product integrity,2,I upgraded from a JBL flip 4 that couldn't hold a charge after about 2 years. I was hesitant about buying a speaker that has only 1 driver but so far I have zero complaints. I run speakers hard at my job and this one has no difficulty at all keeping up with the challenges I give it. It has a huge battery that will certainly last you for hours. I have currently used it for roughly 7 hours at work today at higher volumes and it claims to still be near a full charge. Only time will tell. Another cool thing these speakers can do is connect to other speakers that have the same JBL connect+ feature. Other coworkers have compatible speakers that they love to hook up to it and it certainly turns work into a party! I would highly recommend this speaker if you're looking for something that puts out a high volume and has a great battery life!,162,3.0,2019,02,February,13
Awesome however...,2,I am sorry my fault.,5,5.0,2019,02,February,12
Definitely doesnt worth the price,5,"My buddy 3d printed me some mounts for my can am maverick x3 xmr turbo, and the speakers is plenty loud enough for me to hear on the trail and battery lasted all day and then some.",37,1.0,2019,02,February,08
Jbl the best,3,"I have been a musician my entire life and this thing sounds like utter garbage compared similar JBL speakers.  The one speaker is just horrible.  Go to a store and try for yourself, even the old Link 20 is better sounding.",41,5.0,2019,02,February,07
Very satisfying sound quality. But I have just one issue...,10,"The JBL charge 4 is a great product. I found it to be initially disappointing due to the warm sound signature. I have found that the highs aren’t totally accurate but they’re close enough to not distract you from the music. The highs are present but definitely aren’t strong which adds to the warm signature. The mids are very good and exceptionally clear for the size of this device. Because of this, the vocals are great in most songs. They are well represented unless they sneak up on the high notes which is when you can hear a slight distortion from accuracy. However, the vocals which dip into lower range sound really good as the speaker does a great job not to put too much emphasis on the radiators making it sound bassy and unrealistic. If you listen to high quality hifi tracks you’ll be able to imagine the singer right in front of you because of the presence and sound stage. As for the mono speaker, don’t listen to the critics of this new implementation because most of them either don’t know what they’re talking about or they are just picking at it because they don’t like the thought of it. You’re not going to get stereo by using 2 speakers 3 inches apart like on the last model and as for separation, this mono speaker separates just fine if not better than the last model especially in mid to lows. The speaker gets plenty loud for the average person and it manages to maintain its dynamics all the way to just under full volume. I’ve compared this speaker to many others such as charge 3, xb30, xb31, xb20, extreme, onyx... and what I’ve found is that while the highs are a bit lacking in certain songs it certainly makes up for it in other departments. The bass is very good in the charge 4. The bass notes are represented accurately and it’s able to hit lower frequencies most portable speakers of this size can’t (20). However, it’s worth mentioning it’s still no sub. This speaker has trouble representing very low frequencies. The radiators start shaking instead of making music which for those of you who don’t know (this doesn’t sound very good). The battery life of this speaker wasn’t as advertised and I found I could only get 9 hours on 60 percent volume which isn’t bad but is a huge deviation from the claimed 20 hours. After using this speaker for awhile and comparing it to other speakers, I’ve actually grown fond of this unit and it’s become my beach toy. Don’t take any critics in this review too seriously as I doubt most people are 50% as critical as me when it comes to audio but this one gets my thumbs up. Future improvements would definitely require a tweeter and possibly a bigger battery.",478,4.0,2019,02,February,07
Great sound quality,3,"I never looked into JBL before this.  Sound quality is amazing.  Durability is top notch.  It is sleek and not to bulky.  I have not tested out the waterproof part but I think leave that for another time. The battery lasts a very long time, like it says 20+hrs.  It's also a great backup portable charger for my phone.  I kinda wish I got the bigger one just because I really liked this brand.  This is me saying this not someone telling me to say it, but if you like protecting your things I would also get the carrying case.  I will upload a picture at another time.",108,5.0,2019,02,February,06

Great quality,2,"Very excited for the speaker. I bought it to have on a weekend camping trip, but I didn't realize it was going to come without a full charger! Left me unable to charge it as my other charger doesn't disconnect into a block and a cord, it stays as one. I now have to buy wall block in order to charge this speaker I already spend a lot of money on. Seems like a real cheap way to save money as company.",82,5.0,2019,01,January,27

Great!,1,"My wife complains about how it charges, sometimes it doesn't get a full charge. That might have more to do with how she goes about it though.

Great sound quality for the price,6,"My brother has a pair of JBL Extremes and they sound great outdoors.  I didn't want to go that big (and expensive)  so after some research I purchased a pair of Charge 4's, one from Amazon with points  and one from a Meijer store at a big discount.  I knew that separately they are mono but planned on getting two.  I paired them with my iphone, downloaded the Connect+ app and tried them out in my breezeway and wasn't terribly impressed but that room has cedar walls and ceiling and all hard furniture, so I moved out to the patio. Incredible sound!  I played some Aaron Diehl, Tom Waits, Jade Bird, several genres.  Exceeded my expectations!After listening to just one speaker I would say this might not be what you want if you're going to use one solo. I would probably consider the Charge 3 in that case, but if you connect at least two speakers for stereo sound you won't be disappointed.",163,5.0,2019,01,January,07

Power button brakes,3,"Great speaker. And great seller.  Only con I have found with this speaker is, only having 1 ""driver"" /speaker, it looses the stereo effect of the charge 3, which has two very slightly smaller speakers.  The low tones are better and deeper w the charge 4, but it looses alot of high tones.  The charge 3 picks them up great.  I'll be ordering a 3 in near future to link with the 4, for a full rounded sound.  But, the bass is a lot better with the 4. Still really good sound and great volume eith the 4",98,1.0,2019,01,January,04
Excellent,1,"update: 6/4/2019 From 3 Stars to 4Was having trouble with the JBL connect app but now I got it figured out. Do not have more than 2 connected devices at one time otherwise the app will not work.Once the app worked I could now turn off the audio prompt which was annoying when especially you don't want to disturb anyone.  Now the start up and volume either reached maximum or minimum does not give me the unwanted feedback. Nice!Note:My experience with this speaker was less than 12 hrs.  Also it didn't been through water test just so you guys know.Only single sound driver?? I could tell sound was coming from more from the right side when I had the speaker 2-3 feet away from me and that's my preferred use. That was already a little unpleasant. Next issue was the JBL Connect App didn't work at all. It couldn't find the speaker.  What??Lastly and most importantly, I used my speaker a lot listening to audio book before I go to bed.  When this speaker volume was down to say maybe 5% or so, I could hear random breaking up background noise coming off it.  That was my last draw and unfortunately had to return it.What I would like to is that the light indicator can be controlled via the app but since I couldn't use the app, I wasn't sure if the light indicator could be off or dim somehow.  It is way too bright and unnecessary. Also if possible a LED indicator to show the level of the current volume. It does not have to permanently turned on but fade away after a second or two that will be way better.JBL. JBL. Oh no.",285,5.0,2019,01,January,03
